    I bought this about 9 months ago. The pro: I will use it in my RV. The cons: TOO heavy. Self propelled is great while sweeping forward but makes it a workout when pulling back (which is half of all vacuuming). I am 57 so may be ok for a younger person. It will not stand on it's own so if you need to stop for a moment to pick something up/move you have to lay it down. Also makes storing it hard. Must lean up agains something or hang from a hook. To empty the SMALL dust bucket you have to take it off the stand and fight w/ the long cord that always wants to get in the way. Would never buy again. Bought for basement but will be keeping/using it in my RV instead as it is small.

    Initially I was very impressed and then the clamp on the bag-less container kept coming loose and then a belt broke and I cant find a replacement at any retailer including a repair shop. UGH!!!

    I’ve never written a negative review before, but this is my second Shark product that has gone into the trash bin.  I’d give it five stars for performance but 0 for service.  Since this is the second of two Sharks I’ve trashed due to problems replacing simple, common consumables, I’ll give it one star overall.  These really are great vacuums until they require service, then forget it.  They are awful to try to repair, any access is unnecessarily difficult, and forget about getting help from customer service.  The cord frayed around the keeper on this Rocket.  After removing every screw I could see, and a couple I couldn’t, I still could not access the area to replace the cord.The other Shark vacuum broke a belt, and Shark’s customer service sent me the wrong replacement.  I won’t go into the whole ordeal except to say I had to remove at least twenty five screws and parts to get to the belt.  The old Hoover’s had two.  The ironic part is the Shark advertised that vacuum as “not needing replacement belts”.  Well, it’s a little rubber band, of course it’s going to break.  Again the vacuum worked well until it didn’t.  It chaps me to toss $400 of equipment because I couldn’t replace a $10 part on one and a $5 part on the other. And that didn’t take into account the 5-6 hours I spent on what should have been two five minute jobs.  No more Sharks for our household.

    This vacuum is absolutely useless if you’re used to a standard vacuum. I can not believe how many 5 start reviews it has! What am I missing!!?1) You have to detach the head and drag it and THE ENTIRE CORD with you every single time you empty it. Yes, all 30 feet of the cord!!!! Which is a real blast when your large trash can is across the house (and believe me you need a large trash can, not just a bag, because the dirt goes EVERYWHERE no matter how carefully you empty)2) Speaking of emptying, you’ll be doing that every few minutes if you are vacuuming an entire room. The container that traps dirt is extremely small and the filter clogs in a week (and I’m a very “average” user - not too dirty or dusty or anything dramatic). For example, I just vacuumed a 12x18 room and had to empty twice! No big mess, no real dirt, it’s just such a small and inconvenient container.3. The freakin thing falls over! It does not stand up on its own unless you DRILL a PERMANENT wall mount into one space in your house. I have a kid - this is not even remotely convenient.Ugh. I am so regretting this purchase.

    I bought this vacuum cleaner last year for my wife on Mother's Day. It lasted just over a year and it's pretty much garbage now. The manufacturing of the Plastics is weak and this unit is defective. I should be getting my money back.

    The Shark Rocket is NOT for Senior Citizens because every time you stop using it you have to lay it down. It will not stand up like a normal vacuum.  So you have to BEND over to pick it up which is not easy when you are over 60 years old. Also, I found it very hard to control when trying to vacuum in a straight line. It wants to go all over the place and it is easy to bump into things with it. The dust cannister also has a very SMALL capacity so you are always dumping it if you have a large area to vacuum. Because the vacuum will not stand up you have to put screws in the wall to hang it up or take the motor off and mount it at the bottom which is a PIA. It would probably be a good vacuum for a younger person with a small house or apartment where you have a lot of obstacles to go around because it is very easy to maneuver and you can vacuum under stuff like a bed which is nice but overall I like the regular Shark better. I returned mine in one day.

    I'm not sure if I got a faulty vacuum but this vacuum only picks up stuff on the back stroke and it also throws stuff behind you when you're vacuuming. So you think you've picked stuff up, but really the brushes have just thrown the debris all over behind you. This is the most frustrating, uesless vacuum I have ever used. I'm so disappointed, as the Shark brand vacuums are usually amazing. We do not have carpet, only hardwood. You also can't turn the brushes off, only can turn the speed down. This ones going in the trash, sadly!

    I hate this thing.  HATE.  If the apocalypse comes and it's nuclear war or an asteroid hitting the Earth, my only wish is to survive long enough to see this thing melt.  I am utterly bewildered by the number of positive ratings this thing has. Yes, it's light weight-- it's so light weight, you have to constantly kick the top down to keep contact with the floor.  Second, I don't know what the Hell they're using on their infomercials to show this thing's cleaning power, but I wish I could get video of myself sweeping over and over the same little bitty pieces of dirt.  But here's the final straw-- because my other vacuum is broken, I had to use this to vacuum kitty litter (clean, fortunately) that had spilled on carpet.  It seemed like it was cleaning it up, but as I shifted from carpet to tile hallway, it literally ejected kitty litter all over the place.  It wasn't sucking it up, it was just spinning it around the rollers, and when I switched from carpet to hard floor, the spinning stopped and the kitty litter exploded all down the hall.  AND, when I went to clean out the bin, I discovered the carpet fibers had clogged the machine all the way up the tube.  I had to use an unbent coat hanger to push the clog out of the tube.  There's nothing special about the carpet-- Home Depot bargain bin, nothing challenging.  My Dyson never had an issue with it-- this did one SMALL room and was clogged.Now let's talk about the bin.  The engineering masterminds that made this put the bin on top, and they also put the nice long cord on the same component.  So, to dump the bin, you have to either unplug and carry the cord and all to the trash to dump it, or stay within plug's reach of the trashcan.AND, it does't stand up by itself.  See how it's pictured, all nice and stable?  Yeah-- NO.  You can't even prop it against a wall-- it slides forward and falls.  You have to wedge it in a corner so it won't fall forward or leave your vacuum laying on the floor if you stop vacuuming for a bit.I had a Shark floor steamer for years and I WANTED to like this-- I did.  But it is absolutely horrible.  Horrible design, horrible performance, HORRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY.

    Lasted 6 months before the beater bar stopped working. I bought it for my mom because it was light and she is physically disabled and can’t lift anything heavy.  Yet, the Shark didn’t last long. I called the company and they offered to sell me a new beater bar head. Apparently, the limited warranty is limited to the power head only. Having taken a closer look, the issue is the power connection in the rigid pipe to the power head. Very poor engineering that is bound to fail. With the warranty so limited but the willingness to sell me parts, I will take this as a lesson learned and take my money elsewhere.

    Being a small aged person I was looking for a light weight manoeuvrable vacuum and after doing a lot of research, was sure this would be exactly what I needed.  I purchase items on the internet as they are delivered to my door.  The much excitement when it arrived turned to upset, disappointment and anger when I found I had been sent an American model and I live in Australia, which was certainly known as it did arrive at my door. The motor wattage & voltage in Australia is not compatible with an American motor.  My money was wasted but, more important I haven't received a vacuum that would make my life so much easier.  So it sits in pristine condition neatly packed in it's box as I am not able to find transport to return it.  Such a waste !!!

    I had this product for less than 3 years and the tube broke. They claim these vacuums are made from quality materials and parts. Since it was purchased from amazon it has a limited warranty so they would only cover 50% of the part which is 100 dollar part. Clearly a manufacturing defect the part is meant to bend but doesn't last! Not worth the money!

    Scratched my wood floors. Not sure what happened but the roller started making a loud sound and then it started hitting my floor really hard leaving tiny gouges in the hardwood. I like this vacuum because it has a powerful motor and really picks up dirt, but maybe it's a bit too powerful for real wood floors. The canister is easy to get on and off and I really like all of the attachments. I hang it on the wall for storage. However, it is more top heavy than I would like, and it does not stand up on its own.

    I've had this vacuum for Several years now and the performance is great until it needs repairs. I went to my local vacuum repair shop and was informed that he could not get a authorization to repair their units. I then called shark customer service and asked for their closest repair shop. The man had such a heavy accent that I had trouble understanding him. He kept insisting that I needed to give him the model number so he could make a decision as to whether it was under warranty. I explained to him that it was not under warranty and I just wanted a repair shop. I finally ended up hanging up on the man because I couldn't get him to understand what I needed. I went out and bought a Bissell.

    I hate this vacuum. My boyfriend bought it for us due to the good reviews, but it just doesn't work well. The brush roller knocks items around instead of picking them up and constantly gets tangled with hair. I have to pick up ""larger items"" (like dog food) by hand and sweep afterwards to get dust even after doing multiple passes. I stare at dirt on the ground going over it multiple times praying that it will get sucked up to no avail. It doesn't stand by itself so it gets heavy after while and my arms are exhausted after doing the whole house. Save yourself the trouble and get a Miele.

    I feel like I'm the only one here who thinks this vacuum is horrible.  It is more of an electric broom than a vacuum.  I am using in on low nape carpet and hardwood floors.  I was hopeful that I could use this for light cleaning.  Sadly, no.  From day one, this unit has been underwhelming.The unit pushes dirt behind it, rather than sucking it up.  There is very, very little vacuum being created, despite the noise.  Using it to clean window sills, it won't even suck up a dead fly.  I have cleaned it, removed the filter ... done just about everything I can think of to get better performance.  Finally, I've just gone back to using my heavy canister unit.

We have to open a window after every time we use it, and we're starting to prefer the broom just because of the smell.

They're telling me I am responsible for the shipping.1. Vacuum is clumsy! You can not leave it in the upright position, it will fall over! You must remove the top part and set it on the hook by the base.2. When vacuuming the floor, it it very hard to keep it in a straight line. It wants to swivel left to right.3. The vacuum is pretty loud and high pitched.4. All in all - It's a waste!I use many other Shark products such as the Sonic Duo, Steam Mops and the Rotator Professional Lift away.

    I was very disappointed in this Shark. After owning and using their rotator lift away for our cleaning business, I was excited to see another, what I thought was a quality powerful vacuum. Wrong. It is lightweight and has a long cord but that's where the positive ends. The dust cup is just that, meaning it only holds a cup of dust before it's full. Then, because the dust cup does not detach from the motor to be emptied, you either need to drag the trash can to you or unplug the vacuum, carry the whole unit to the can, and strategically hold the cord out of the way to dump the cup. The suction is mediocre at best but I guess that's better or you'll be emptying the cup every thirty seconds. Since the cord wraps around the motor and the cleaner head, you cannot break the vacuum down into smaller bits without getting creative with the cord. Lastly, the exhaust comes out of the back of the cleaner so it always points at your head and will get really loud if you use more than five minutes.

    I am in morning- my shark just died. when I purchased about 1.5 years ago this vacuum did a great job. the suction seemed great, light to carry around, and grabbed a lot of pet hair. I was happy, now I am not. In the last 10 months of so I could barely make 5 passes without the tube getting clogged with pet hair globs. The brush would grab all the hair and not suck very much in the tube and if it did all would get clogged in the tube. I have the same amount of pet hair that I've had for 10 years- so the suction on this shark is crap! One of the things I researched when I purchased the Shark was the promise of great suction. More suction then the dyson and for a fraction of the price. I know things break over time but I expect my vacuum to last atleast a few years before real troubles begin. Alas, I am tossing another broken vacuum in the trash. I plan on calling Shark customer service and see if I can return this piece of crap.

    I purchased this almost a year ago. For the first few months, worked great, exactly like other reviews claimed. So I'm mostly writing to report the longevity.It doesn't have any. I completely cleaned the filter, completely cleaned the brush, emptied the container, and it didn't help. This thing simply doesn't suck anymore. I clean two rooms and there's hardly anything in the container, it doesn't pick stuff up off the floor that I can obviously see, and after I finish vacuuming (where I go over the same area 3 times), the floor still doesn't even look clean! Additionally, it straight up spits stuff back out. If I lift the vacuum at all, I get bombarded with little shards of things. Essentially, the brush head seems to grab stuff, but the suction has stopped working. Huge disappointment, will definitely be going back to a full upright container vacuum. :(

    I didn't buy this from Amazon, but want to let people know that I really dislike this vacuum and am sorry that I paid what I did.  For what you get it should only be around $40 or $50. The suction is terrible, yes it does pick up dust and animal fur, but if something just a little heavier is next to the wall...forget it, be prepared to bend over or go back over the floor with a broom. Yes, it is light weight but you have to hold it up the whole time you are vacuuming it will not stand up on its own...ever! It will get heavy if you have a normal to large room. Every time I have to pick up something that it wouldn't vacuum up, I have to lay the Rocket on the floor. I should have bought another Hoover, love my 18 year old Hoover, it is falling apart but it still has powerful suction. I just wanted something not so heavy.

    I am so disappointed in this vacuum.  I owned a Shark before and loved it. It is like this is a completely different brand.  It does not have enough suction to pick up simple crumbs from my kitchen floor!  After I vacuum, I have to get on my hands and knees and pick up everything it missed by hand.  It's ridiculous!  All for the privilege of paying $200!  As I'm vacuuming, I can see it spitting things out the back.  When I turn around, the spots I just finished vacuuming are covered with more crumbs than were there before I vacuumed.  And, it's not because it's jammed up or needs to be emptied.  I'm so pissed that I need to go purchase another vacuum after paying so much for this one!

    Love my Shark Navigator so I expected to love this even more. I was excited to be able to get under the furniture with this one. Totally disappointed within seconds of use. The good--It has great suction just like any other Shark. The bad--The weight is at the top, making for a sore arm after vacuuming just the living room. Very awkward and uncomfortable. Because the bottom is light and top is heavy the bottom was constantly lifting off the ground when I tried to maneuver the vacuum, which I had to do a lot because it kept going in its own direction. The handle has a ribbed rubber grip that rubs a blister with prolonged use. And the final issue I had is that it doesn't stand up on it's own. I let go of my vacuum several times while cleaning so that I can move things and this one needs to be laid down. Not a big issue but inconvenient and when added to other bigger issues it was a total aggravation.

    This is the first vacuum I have ever purchased.  I had much confidence in my initial decision to purchase a Shark vacuum.  I even opted to spend a little more than I wanted, because I wanted to invest in a machine that I thought would last longer than some of the others I was considering.  I had heard great things about Shark products, however now I have lost all confidence.  The base of the vacuum stopped working within the first 2 months.  I purchased the vacuum in May 2017 and now it no longer functions.  I called Shark's customer support and they offered to ship out a new base free of charge, which is great, however, they made me pay for the shipping ($17).  I would understand if I had owned this vacuum for a long period of time, however the bigger issue is that the vacuum simply broke after 2 months.  Additionally, the vacuum is poorly designed and is hard to maneuver.  Do yourself a favor and invest in a different product.

    I hate it.  Have had it for a year now.  All it does it push the dirt around on my area rug.  I have to get it all in the middle or at the side of the rug and then use the hose to vacuum it up. Takes me an hour to vacuum a 12 by 16 area rug!!  Yes, I keep it clean.  Keep the filter clean.  Empty it all the time.  If I run into the furniture, the beater brush stops.  Will never ever buy a Shark again.  Oh actually, my Shark portable for the car works better than this and it was about $300 less

    After having and loving for 6 months I am very frustrated.  The belt broke.  Normally a simple repair.  Not.  After taking 12  screws out we then resorted to an ice pick to be able to remove the brush.  Ok so we finally got it apart.  The belt we ordered off amazon did not fit.  To large. I specifically looked for the question about the size before i ordered. Am ordering from another site tonight. A week with 4 kids and two dogs is taking a toll on my house!!!

    I purchased this product from Sears about a year ago as I was looking for an all-around lightweight vacuum cleaner for hardwood floors, rugs that would also take care of pet fur. The product does do all those, BUT it is poorly designed in the following areas. The beater brush is constantly getting tangled with whatever is on the floor (such as pet hair) and has to be laboriously cleaned by hand every time the product is used. There is no easy way to clean the beater brush and you just have to use your fingers to pick out all the debris accumulating there. Further the plastic dust cup gets clogged after just 5 minutes of use because all the dust and debris that the vacuum picks up stays up in the narrow entrance and does not get pushed down the wider part of the cup and instead just backs up into the wand. This causes the vacuum motor to start overheating very quickly.  Overall, a poorly designed product that I would not recommend.

    So it worked great for the first 6 months, but it kind of slowed down and now I am at the point of buying another Vacuum... I had high hopes because of all the reviews, but I wouldn't buy another one.

    I bought this for my wife and I to use instead of lugging out the cumbersome electrolux. It is very light, and has some real suction power to it. It's easy to clean out too. A lil on the pricey side, but I hope it lasts a few years so I get my money's worth.***1/23/19- 9am Update***I had to replace the top head unit once. The plastic hinge broke, so I called up shark and they sent out a new unit for $20. Not bad.Next thing I need to replace is the beater brush/head unit. I think it's wearing out because it's not picking up hair from the dog n cat anymore.  So I'm off to look for a replacement.The vacuum has been great for us. I have no complaints. It has done all that I wanted it to.***1/23/19 - 3pm Update***So i just got off the phone with shark cs. man what a joke. The vacuum head is not covered under the 5 year warranty.  the cost to replace it will be $99 or $47.95 with a one time discount. So, on top of the $200 I spent to purchase it, they now want me pay another 50 bucks. I don't think so.When this thing dies, it's going in the trash. I'll never buy another shark vacuum again.

    A gift this Christmas for my wife so she can quickly vacuum up minor crumbs, etc and mainly for the car, instead of dragging out the regular vacuum cleaner,  & shop vac for car.  Her first comment was its to heavy......then the vacuum cleaner dosen't even stand by itself.  If I knew this, I wouldn't have purchased to begin with.  Its packed nicely and going back.

    This did not come with dust-away hard floor attachment and microfiber pad like it says. I ordered this for that tool. So don't believe what it says. Now I am going to have to figure out how to get it all in the box to return it.

    It broke not even a year used. The flex hose from the head broke after few months, bought the hose separately and changed the hose then worked for a month and now the brushes stopped spinning. Called manufacturer they said the don't cover anything except the main motor of the vacuum, and that everything else is sold separately to buy.

    I started writing this review about 3 minutes ago and it was stopped and I wasn't able to finish. No matter, I was vacuuming and the whole wand broke off. I stopped and went to unplug and the connection between the canister  and the wand started  arcing. The vacuum no longer works. Needless to say. No pun , but it really shocked me. If you own this model please be careful . I have had this unit for over a year no trouble till now. I really liked it.

    I have had Shark products in the past and they were great!! But this Rocket is  total disappointment; it is cumbersome to use and the floor and tools barely pick up!! You have to go over the areas multiple times and even then it will not pick up!! The bagless container fills up too fast and it is a pain to clean out!

    Warranty only covers motor.  Does not cover any of the other parts, such as the problematic vacuum head.  Not only that, the website has been giving the same error for 3 weeks:  ""The product registration cannot be completed at this time. Please try again later.""  Without registration, they will reject any warranty claims.  buyer beware.

    BOUGHT THEIR LESS EXPENSIVE UPRIGHT VACUUM WITH TOOLS; TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS VACUUM WHICH HAS BETTER SUCTION AND VERSATILITY. ""Good"" suction for BARE FLOORS AND CARPET. BUT SHARK UPRIGHT WITH TOOLS CLEANS BETTER FOR DOG'S AND CAT'S HAIR AND VERY QUIET. JUST DOESN'T VACUUM UNDER FURNITURE.

    Update... After 16 months the plastic pieces holding the pin in place (for the dust bin door) broke off. I now have a Velcro strap holding it together but it doesn't seal well enough to maintain sufficient suction. Warranty only covers items purchased directly from Shark LLC. Apparently this does not include Amazon. Extremely frustrating to say the least.Love this vacume. I have to empty it a couple of times, but it does an excellent job on pet hair. We have wood and carpet and it works well on both. It goes right under the furniture, the swivel head is very useful.

    so this was bought in 2016 but was usd infrequently as it has a small capacity cup so we used it for general spot cleaning and not for carpet, well our main vacuum went up so we started using it as the main vac for a little while and in no time at all the brush was bound up and even after fully cleaning it of hair it still can not be moved, not by hand or by the motor.unless you live in a 1 floor apartment with all hardwood i can not recommend this vacuum at all, way to expensive for not much vacuum

    Unit worked well, very light use in very short carpet basement - only used a couple of times a month for a few minutes at time. Motor burnt out in August after purchase in February of same year. Under warranty but Shark (it's in the warranty fine print) hits you for $20 shipping for warranty replacement. Fail. Despite how good units work (we have a larger one two on it's THIRD motor), durability is a joke and warranty coverage charges are obviously because durability is so low.

    *** update*** ended up buying the replacement head and now here we are a year later and the exact same part melted again. Do not buy this vacuum cleaner unless you don’t mind the frustration and the $99 annual replacement head. I am extremely disappointed in this shoddy product. My last vacuum cleaner from Sears is still working after ten years.Loved this little light vacuum at first but here we are in December 2018, (I ordered this September 9th) so it’s been about three months we’ve used this vacuum cleaner, and it no longer works. I’m thinking should be covered under warranty, right?! Nope. A new vacuum cleaner head will cost me $99, almost as much as a new vacuum. Don’t waste your money. This company does not stand behind their product.

    This is the worst product ever. This threw dirt and dust around my home. On top of that the customer service from Shark stinks. I would recommend that NO ONE PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. They (Shark) do not stand behind this product and do not care about the customer.

    This Shark Rocket is light weight, and has a long power cord, but that is all I can say about it, my old Bissel Trilogy picks up twice as good as this.  I am extremely disappointed.

    Constantly the metal tube gets clogged and the vacuum just spits things out. Even if it's not clogged it misses a lot of stuff definitely can't pick up kitty liter and is useless on my hardwood and tile floors. Such a waste of money

    Disappointing that Shark has deceptively written this product description to keep popping up under searches for ""CORDLESS vacuums"", as it LOOKS like the Dyson and Hoover CORDLESS models.  In fact no where in this product description does it mention cord OR battery. And even makes a pretty intentional effort to NOT actual show the power CORD in the pictures. Surprise. It is a plug in. Wonder how much Amazon loses on return shipping due to this obviously intentional misleading advertising?

    I don't know how this piece of crap gets such rave reviews!  I must have gotten the one bad one in the bunch. If you want a vacuum that doesn't do edges, or bare floors and doesn't do that great on rugs then this is your guy! It is also super hard to find filters for. If anyone thinks it compares to a Dyson they need intense therapy!! This was the worst 135.00 I ever spent on a vacuum. My 20 year old Hoover picks up better than this. This is probably the worst vacuum out there.

    The vacuum worked good for 9 months then stopped working. Wish I had never bought it. This is the second Shark vacuum that  only lasted a year each. They were both duds. I contacted the manufacturer and got nothing but a run around. I wasted my money  twice..never again!!

    Who thought that putting the motor and canister at the top, was a goog idea? I did not even finish putting together, or even try it. The entire device is top heavy, and had to be propped up in a corner. Really bad design! Always loved Shark, but disappointed in this one.

    This worked great for a year and recently the motor started fading in and out while in the carpet setting. Shark offers 5 year warranty so we called but, of course, the broken part was not covered under the warranty. It is a $100 part, for which they offered a discount. But even still, we’re assuming this is a part we would need to replace every year that is not covered under warranty? No thanks, we might as well just buy a new vacuum from a store with a better return policy.When it did work, it worked great on our tile floors but some other cons are:- Since the cord is connected to the collection “bucket” (not sure what it’s called), you have to unplug it and take the entire thing out to the trash to empty it. More of a hassle than a defect.- It is rather top-heavy and can become and arm workout if you’re vacuuming on carpet for too long.

    I received this as a present from my Husband. I've let him know it's now going to be the upstairs vacuum cleaner. All over the box it says picks up better than Dyson...yea right. I have a Dyson and trust me Shark is no Dyson.It continually shot dirt back out, it wouldn't even pick up little pieces of dried grass, seriously? I went over my floor until my arms and wrist hurt and said enough is enough.I brought my little Bissell lift off back downstairs to use in the kitchen. It works way better. Please don't tell me this wasn't made for tile or hard floors, it should work, my Dyson vacuum cleaner does. This is also to big to fit up underneath my cabinets which my Dyson and Bissell both do. So I ended up having to use a broom to sweep up underneath them. If you want to use this on any hardwood or tiled areas I can't recommend it.

    HORRIBLE.  I had this model sweeper for 4 years when it quit.  My sweepers get used hard with 3 dogs in the house.  I got the exact same model because I loved it but the new one only pushes the hair around and doesn't even fill the canister when sweeping.  My last sweeper I would empty twice per room.  Very disappointed.

    Loved this as long as it worked-very light use so don’t plan on it lasting long. We used it mainly for carpeted stairs & nooks & crannies that were hard to get to. Not used much because we had a bigger vacuum - the cord shorted out after less than 3 years.  Don’t waste your money. Buy something better.
