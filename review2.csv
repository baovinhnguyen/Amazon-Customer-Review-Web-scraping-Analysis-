    Light yes,  and powerful as well  But....while a large number of consumers are  delightedI am confused.This vacuum DOES NOT STAND UPRIGHT and is very top heavy. The motor is placed at the top of the handle, a strange design choice.The cannister is a disaster. It is far too tiny for carpet work and it DOESNOT DETACH !  so emptying it is a clumsy task and a messy one .Because it cannot be detached it cannot be cleaned easily., Rocket engineersshould go back to the drawing board and fix these features.

    I was looking for something that would vacuum laminate or other hard flooring under beds and low clearance furniture where dust collects. I have very few carpets. I found the handle not long enough for cleaning under a king sized bed and the dust / microfiber floor attachment head impossible to control from a horizontal position. Easily controlled vertically but poor design and uncontrollable when the vacuum is horizontally used; the floor attachment head moves uncontrollably side to side.  I also did  not want to use the microfiber cloth (may as well use a dust mop - just interested in the suction) but operating without the cloth seems to mean dragging the plastic piece (designed to hold the cloth) over the floor which I didn't want to do. The carpet / floor head worked better but I don't like the brush turning  over the hard floors (even at the slow speed) and the head is too thick for low clearance furniture. Seems to be an okay vacuum otherwise but poorly designed for my specific intent.

    I had a Shark vacuum that bit the dust after years of everyday use and loved it so much, I knew I wanted another Shark. I should've bought the same model and not this one for these reasons..1. It's awkward using a top heavy vacuum when you're used to most of the weight being on the bottom.2. It doesn't stand up by itself. You either have to lean it on a wall just right so it doesn't slide down, or put it on the holder thing that comes with it that you have to install in a closet or door.3. The capacity of the dirt canister is horrible. I have a 2 story house with carpet upstairs and on the steps, and rugs downstairs. Just figure that for every full canister you're used to emptying, this will have to be emptied at least 3 times.4. Before it's really full and needs to be emptied, sometimes it makes a weird noise and you have to kinda tap the air vent lookin part. So annoying!I guess for someone who only has a rug on hardwood floors or a New York sized apartment, this would be great if you can get past the top heaviness. But I have 4 kids and a lot of carpet and just want to freaking vacuum without it being a big ordeal. I only had this for a few months and ended up getting the full sized Shark pro and I'm in love with my vacuum again.

    I am known as the Vacuum Queen in my family. I purchase a new one at least every two years. I hope I get at least two years out of this one before giving it away. I'm hoping I just have to get use to the design and size.Like any new vacuum, it picks up well. However, there are several problems with the design. 1. If you are short or have problems bending, it is extremely awkward trying to wrap the cord around the cord hooks. 2. It is heavy on the wrist when trying to use the handheld portion of the vacuum while cleaning overhead (a hose on an upright vacuum is far superior). 3. It does not stand on its own, so if you have to momentarily turn off the vacuum, you either have to lie it on the ground or position it between two pieces of furniture. It will slide and hit the floor if you just lean it against the wall, and I do not like the idea of having to hang my vacuum when storing it. 4. The canister lock is a bit tricky, and if it is not properly closed or when having to empty it over a garbage can, you're in for a real mess.

    I’ve owned this vacuum for 2-3 years now and I still HATE it. Stupidest design ever!!  Doesn’t stand up by itself, and the part that you empty is connected to the cord so you have to drag the cord and canister out to empty it. Pros:  good suction and light weight.

    So I really liked the versatility of this vacuum.... the long stick was very helpful to use under beds and furniture, After like one week the motor started making a loud noise. I cleaned the vacuum after each use, so that was not the problem, and soon it just stopped working.... burn smell. Motor was done. Took it back to Bed bath and beyond and replaced it for the same one cause I liked it, It worked for a good 6 months and then same exact thing happen. So I am done with any Shark. Im looking for another brand with similar description

    Does it clean well. Definitely, except on hardwoods, it slides all over, hard to control. I very seldom use it.  My Shark Navigator works better.  The vacuum is extremely top heavy since the motor is at top.  Because of the location of the motor, it blows hot air onto your chest/middle during use. Since it doesn’t stand up alone, you must find a place to lean it which usually means it will slip to floor.The ad was great sounding but I wasted $$$$on a poorly designed vacumn.  Not my first rodeo, I’ve owned vacs for 52 yrs. This is the worse  for sure.

    I have had this thing for about a year and am disappointed.  Yes it ""works"", but there are so many things I don't like about it I thought I would pass along since this has gotten really positive reviews overall. That's why I bought it and you should know before you do:1) It doesnt stand up on its own when you put the head on the stick, which is annoying when you need to stop for a minute to move the plug, etc. It's too top heavy when fully assembled.2) The empty dust bin is configured so oddly - you just end up getting all the gross stuff all over your hand when you open the dispenser which is disgusting, the way it has to be opened and held.3) It's got a very small container that needs emptied almost every time I vacuum - and my house is only 1200 sf.4) It just doesn't have the greatest suction. Even when on a 100% clean bin I run the vacuum, afterwards I see left over particles on both the rug and the hardwood/tile floors.Overall, just OK but I was disappointed and probably won't buy another Shark product.

    I was so excited to see this on sale for Black Friday. I wanted to get one for a while. It works great and picked up so much dirt. However, it only gets 2 stars because it is way too too heavy with the canister being on the handle. It hurt my hand and arm to use it for only a few min. The actually handle that your hand goes into is very uncomfortable and hurts the top of your hand when pushing the vacuum. The vacuum head that goes on the floor is very small and it’s so powerful with pulling that it’s hard to know that you got the whole carpet because it swivels too easily and doesn’t go in a straight line. The canister is also the part that is attached to the cord and since it’s so small you have to empty it after each room and unplug it to carry it to the garbage then re plug it in and reattach it to the vacuum. I would still like a shark vacuum since it’s so good at cleaning but I’m going to return this one for one with the canister on the bottom like a regular vacuum. I’m sad I have to take it back since it had such great reviews and I was very excited to buy it. I hope the next one I get is much easier to use.

    I own two Shark Navigator upright vacuum cleaners and use them for both hard floor and carpet/rugs.  This is a simple review comparing the Navigator to the Rocket.Cons against Rocket:1)  The dust canister is very small compared to the one for Navigator.2)  The dust canister is not removable from the motor and the electrical cord.  In order to dump the content of the dust canister in the garage, I have to take the main unit plus the cord out to the garage.  I definitely don't recommend cleaning out the dust canister in your living area.3)  It's true that Navigator is heavier compared to the Rocket.  But I use an attachment for cleaning the bare floor, and maneuvering the attachment is so much easier than doing it with the Rocket.  In order words, I use the Navigator like it is a canister vacuum.  My left hand drags the vacuum, and my right hand maneuvers the floor attachment.  It is a fast and powerful job.4)  Rocket has much less suction than Navigator.Pro:1)  Rocket is smaller than Navigator.I didn't give this item one star because if someone were to give it to me for free or nearly free, I would keep it.  But at over $100, it is not a keeper.

    I’ve had this vacuum for a few years. It worked great as a floor cleaner. I found it difficult to use in small places since it does not have a hose. Last week the door for the dust cup came off dropping dirt all over my carpet. The plastic that holds on the screw broke so it’s not repairable.  Very disappointing.

    Yes, it's a super-light upright bagless with great suction, but it has more cons than pros.  You've read the good.  Here are the problems that make me regret this purchase.  It is very cheaply and flimsily constructed.  I had to return two of these, within a month, for problems.  The first one's rotating brush stopped working after about a week of use.  The second one had a short that made the engine cut off in the middle of the job.  Now, the third one, which I've had too long to return for replacement, had the door to the dust compartment fall off.  It had fallen off before, when the pin slipped out, but this time it couldn't be repaired due to its flimsy construction.  (The door's metal pin fits into two tiny, thin plastic eyelets that are sure to snap off after emptying the unit a few times, even when it's done carefully.  The inertia from the automatic flip open, upon releasing the catch, is enough to snap them right in two.)  Now for the pick up problem.  When the vacuum is used in the upright position, with the brush spinning, it only picks up correctly when it's pushed forward.  When the unit is pulled backward, (as all vacuums must be when they are in use,) the brush shoots the dust and debris that it passes over out of the rear of the machine.

    It's decent, the brush works great but this thing has weak suction power.  Without the brush on the main part if the vacuum,  it's not good for using accessories because the suction power is so weak.Also this is nice for smaller houses or apt. Don't bother if you have a house bigger than 1800 Sq ft.I honestly dont get why people love this vacuum, I couldnt even pick up pine needles from the Christmas tree, they got picked up but they didnt get sucked in all the way to the bagless disposer, when I shook the vacuum all the pine needles fell out.Without the brush this thing is worthless, zero power using accessories.

    I ordered this based on the reviews here but will be sending it back.  It does indeed vacuum well like people said.  However, it is ridiculously heavy and awkward.  The handle is so long that I have to hold my hand way up in the air just to use it, my arm sticking up and out like a chicken wing.  It's super awkward and gets very uncomfortable because there is nothing ""ultra-light"" about this vacuum at all...  it's heavy.  It also doesn't stand up on it's own.  You have to lean it up against something (or use the wall attachment).  This is super inconvenient as I often have to stop vacuuming for a few minutes to tend to my kids and I can't just stop where I am and leave this vacuum.  I really wanted to like it but it's so awkward and heavy that it's going back.

    I bought this a couple of months ago and only use it on the hardwoods because it is quick and agile. BUT there is no little kickstand or anything to help you stand it UP when you are stopping to unplug it, etc. Seriously- the motor at the top tips it over, and it is heavy enough that I stay away from the sheetrocked walls, and just lay it down on the floor- then I have to stoop back over to get it up. They should be CLEAR about this. It is majorly inconvenient and a simple, sturdy,  tripod snap on would help keep it upright. I have a full size shark and I love it. I got this to go under things, and to a certain extent, it does. But what a PAIN to have to lean it up against things and worry about banging it into a floor or wall. If I hadn't already used it a few times and gotten rid of the box, I would have returned it to amazon.UPDATE- I didn't straighten out the picture in the manual in the picture below, but it CLEARLY states ""this vacuum does NOT stand up on its own"" along with the usual personal injury warning.  I got a reply from sharp via amazon email- and the person didn't seem to even notice their own warning on page 7. He said to look at the convenient hook option on page 13- which is the accessories page! So, just take it from me, You cannot stand this unit up - it is too top heavy. I would assume that without a tripod or kickstand, all top heavy  units like this cannot stand alone.

    I am starting to have a lot of problems with this vacuum. At first it was awesome. I have been using it for about 6 months now and i clean it properly but it is getting clogged really easy and throwing dust and dirt back out. It also stirs up a lot of dust without actually sucking it up. I am disappointed in this vacuum.

    The dust cup lock is broke. I've only had it a little over a month.i cannot return it after 1mo. Now I have to tape it shut so dirt doesn't fall out. Also it does not have a removable dirt container. You have to unplug it take the whole thing to the trash or remove the motor part and take that over.

    So disappointed in this vacuum.  I have been a Shark product customer for at least 14 years, and have made numerous referrals and given Shark products as gifts.  I've believed for years the Shark products are the best on the market at their price point.  Unfortunately, this model does not live up to that reputation.  My last vacuum was the Navigator II design, and it performed very well - strong suction and held a firm seal on the floor.  This model, the Ultra-Light Upright, does not hold a seal, has no strength at the edge, and fails miserably in power.  Very disappointed in its performance and would not recommend.

    I'll admit I'm not extremely buff, and I'm not a crossfit person.  But I'm pretty fit, have 2 young kids, and don't think of myself as a couch slug either.  However, this vacuum is SO HEAVY.  After 15 minutes of switching hands the whole time, my shoulders are sore.  I can't even imagine cleaning the ceilings like the adds.  And I wouldn't want to vacuum the stairs either.  Ha.  You can even see from the pictures that all the weight is in the handle, and it won't stand on it's own -- it tips over.  On one hand, I guess this is a good form of exercise for a New Year's Resolution.

    FELL FOR IT..Use setting is.. 2600SQFT multi-level home. 1s floor all hardwood. A 18x23ft family room. carpetBDRM 1-4 all carpet and upstairs hall and loft carpet. Family of 6 wife,hubby work 9-5. all that to say we use the Shark Rocket @ least 2-4 times a week. less during school days no ones really home. We noticed after the 1st 6months of owning the shark..it would lose suction quickly. We know to clean collection bin and filter.. and we now have to do that in the middle of sweeping just 1 room. I can only sweep half the family room before it loses suction. so a 7-10 min sweep job turns into 20-25 minutes. This is unacceptable.. So do i recommend this to a potential buyer?? ONLY if you are in a SMALL apartment OR if your going to designate it's use to one level or large room. If you have a larger housing over 100sqft.. i would recommend getting a larger upright that can handle larger areas and more rooms.II give it 2 star for misleading it's abilities to be a superb stand-alone sweeper..when in fact for an average size house,,you will need a larger capacity sweeper to assist.UPDATE:I discovers that this sweeper has 2 filters. A thick piece of foam and think cloth like piece right under the foam. Most likely the hepa filter. The combination of the two actually diminishes the suction. I removed the hepa-filter and the suction is waaayyy much better. Since we have no pets and is used in a low traffic area. It made for better use on hard surfaces as well as carpet.

    Bought this about 4 months ago and the wive HATES it.  Constantly clogs (we have 2 dogs) and you need to break-down the whole assembly to get to the culprit.  It could be clogged in the base, the extension tube, or most likely the tube connecting the extension to the base.  Wife is miserable and I am now forbidden from buying vacuums again (things could be worse!)  This thing is about to hit craigs list.  I think its more appropriate for a single person without pets in an apartment.

    I was told that by someone that they liked this better than their dyson. Well I don't think so! It doesn't even come close!  It feels cheap and flimsy. The suction is ok. I have to go over things twice. It self propels too much. It takes off on you just like its name ""rocket"" which leaves it harder to control even when I have it on the lowest setting. My arm hurts after I'm done. The sweep is very narrow, more time vacuuming. Small collection canister. Have to empty twice. The only thing I like is that I can vacum under the bed.

    The rocket is supposed to be lightweight, flexible and powerful. It's definitely powerful, but it's unwieldy, the capacity isn't great and it doesn't corner as well as they would have you believe.I don't find it easy to store. In some ways, it's a victim of trying to serve the needs of a hand-held while trying to be as durable as an upright.I'm sticking with my hoover and telling others that you really need to decide your preference.

    I would not describe this vacuum as lightweight by any means.  As a matter of fact, I thought the top part was so heavy that it hurt my arm and should to use it, and I am in good shape.  I would not recommend this vacuum if you are looking for something ""Ultralight"" because it is far from that.

I'm debating sending it back. I'm 52 years old and healthy, but this wears my arm out!  No way could the picture of the woman holding it up vacuuming above her head work.  After using it I feel like I've been to the car wash using the wand to wash my car. My shoulder was very sore the next day. All the weight is in the top and you must hold it up the whole time. It won't stand alone and it pulls itself along quite strongly, so I feel like I'm fighting it the whole time.
