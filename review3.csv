    This vacuum was great for about 1.5 years (used 1-2 times per week).  I've had it a little over  2 years now and the suction has decreased quite a bit the past year. I've cleaned all the filters regularly and the roller too so I'm out of solutions and have realized it's just not as good as it once was :(.

    We bought this brand because we have had a little Shark Delux vacuum for years and we love it.  Light, durable, and works great.This works well, and is easy to handle, but the noise is intolerable.  So loud and high-pitched.  I used to work construction and very few noises bother me, but this thing drives me out of the house when my wife uses it.

    I just got this, after ordering the TruePet and having to return it because they sent me the Deluxe Pro instead.  I'm going to compare this and the Deluxe Pro.Here's what I love about BOTH vacuums:1) They are CRAZY good at getting up dirt.  I've had an Oreck XL for many years, and it was on its last legs.  I got this thing, and one run over my carpets and the dust cup had to be emptied.  It got up sand and dirt that the Oreck couldn't touch.  It's mortifying that my Oreck was so ineffective in the end, but also incredibly impressive that the Shark Rocket is so effective.2) They are both lightweight, and convenient.  Sure, neither stands upright when the vacuum attachment is on the pole.  So what.  I've found that, in my experience, most vacuums start being iffy on that front after a few years.  The little part that locks it in place often wears down and causes it to unlock easily.  I don't mind that.3) The filter system and clear dust cups are awesome.  I have long-haired Pomeranians, a long-haired daughter, and in my ""older age"" am losing more hair than I care to admit.  The interior dust-cup filter does not miss a THING!  Within a minute, it's wrapped with hair I didn't even see on the ground!4) The ability to detach the pole and turn it into a hand-vac is awesome!  I love the fact I can use it on my couches, my steps, blinds, in the car, etc with ease.Here's the bad about this one:1) First and foremost, and absolutely critical to ME is the fact that the dust cup itself doesn't unclip from the vacuum!  You literally have to unplug the entire vacuum housing to empty the cup!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  What were they thinking?  I thought it was removable like the DeluxePro and went to unclip it, only to have the top open up and all the contents of the dust cup splatter everywhere.And, because of #2 below, you have to empty it twice as often!2)  The dust cup is twice as small on this model as on the DeluxePro, TruePet, and DuoClean.  Although it looks to be the same size, the difference is that the interior cone filter is separated from the rest of the cup, which limits its capacity by half.  It also makes it next to impossible to clean off that interior cone filter--which is where all the hair collects.  Total design failure.The good thing about this one is that it comes with more accessories--although, in truth, they are accessories you can get independently that don't even have to be OEM, so...not really too impressed with that.All in all, if you are going to get one, I'd definitely recommend the Deluxe Pro over this one.  I believe the TruePet is just the Deluxe Pro with an additional Pet brush, so that's a better choice as well, if you have pets.  But the fact that the dust cup doesn't detach is a total buzzkill for me and I am sending this bad boy back.

    I've owned this vacuum for 3 years now. I honestly don't like it at all anymore. I only gave it 3 stars because I think it was probably half decent when I first got it. It does have fairly decent suction but I will be replacing it very soon because I'm tired of it for my hard floors.. It misses so much and my dust mop does a much better job. It's always got hair stuck in the roll and around the little metal filter part in the canister. Also, unless you plan on mounting it to the wall with the plate, it's not quick and convenient to get out and out up every time. The cord is super long which is honestly a pro for me so I don't have to plug it in every time I go to a different spot in the house.

    This vacuum rocks! I love the versatility of it, and the fact that you don't have to change bags. I wouldn't recommend this being your only vacuum for a large house, as it's not the largest, but they do make bigger models for that. The attachments are great and you don't have to buy the motorized attachment for say the steps because this one breaks down small enough to do that already.Update 2017. Last month the container that collects the debris broke. The part that broke is the hinge that holds it on to the vaccuum. So not even 3 years into using it, already broken. Of course there's nothing you can do after the 1 year warranty is up. I'd buy a full size one not this.

    This vacuum cleaner works well BUT you have to empty the small canister often, and the part that you hold in your hand is heavy!  I like that it easily converts to a hand-held vac for stairs, and cracks and crevices, but I don't recommend using it for long periods of time because it begins to hurt your wrist.  As I said, it cleans well but I'm glad I didn't spend more for it.  I am a fan of most of the Shark products, and have used them for years!  So far, though, my all-time FAVORITE Shark vacuum is the ultra LIGHT-WEIGHT upright vac. which I bought 5 or 6 years ago!  (I don't know if they even make that model anymore.)  This vac is supposed to be light-weight but the hand-held canister is NOT.

    This vacuum works great on rugs & is worth 5 stars but it doesn't pick up when it comes to my wood floors & is only worth 1 star. The hand piece is also quite heavy & the hot air blowing out from it becomes uncomfortably inconvenient when you have more vacuuming to do.

    Great suction and really easy to use attachments.  Only major complaint is that it is a bit top heavy making it hard to maneuver and because of that, you cannot stand it upright.  It has to either rest against something like a wall or be laid down when not in use.  Otherwise it is easy to empty, fits into tight spaces and does a great job.

    I have a love/hate relationship with my Shark Rocket.  Love the ability to get under furniture and the power, never had one that felt like it was going to take off and pull me across the room!  The hate part (actually I'll just say  ""dislike"") is the weight of the motor (top) part and the inability to easily stand it up and walk away.  You either lay it down or secure the vacuum head to keep the whole thing half way upright, like in a hallway with each end against a wall.  While the swivel of the vacuum part is nice it's also a pain since it swivels when you don't want it to.  I don't think I would buy it if I had been given a chance to try it out first.  But my husband bought it for me and the money didn't come out of my household budget so that's a good thing and I'm not telling him it's only ""OK"".

    I switched from an upright Dirt Devil which is very old and still working just fine, but really heavy. My back and age needed a lighter weight vacuum. This is light. Almost too light. When you make a pass with it, the end farthest away from you angles up because it is so light. It doesn't have the weight to hug the floor.I don't like that I have to have the cord undone to empty it. It doesn't hold enough dirt and is awkward to empty.With this vacuum, I have to do a LOT of bending. I have to manage the cord while I use it and bend up and down to wind the cord back up. I have to bend over the trashcan to empty the container. I have 3 bad discs in my lower back. None of this is good for me.It seems to vacuum well enough, but the head is so small in width that I need twice as many passes to finish the room! It really is small.I don't like that it won't stand on it's own.I wish there were an onboard clip to fasten the tools. I had to stick them in a drawer that I had to empty. Doubt they'll get used much as it is just too inconvenient.  For some reason, I thought there was a clip, but I must have been thinking of another one.The micro tools are a nice touch, but again- doubt I'll use them.Vacuuming itself doesn't hurt my back too much; whereas, the old one lead to some serious pain killers. It was awful to push that thing around. Still works like a charm, though. By the feel of this one, it won't last as long. Feels cheap.So, obviously, I'm torn about this one. I haven't decided yet whether to return it for a better version or not, but I am seriously considering the DeluxePro Shark.  https://smile.amazon.com/Shark-DeluxePro-Ultra-Light-Upright-Bordeaux/dp/B00NGVF4II I like the lights and onboard tools.

    This is so very top heavy, it hurts my back. It is difficult to maneuver. The floor part won’t stay down and keeps locking up for standing position.  It doesn’t hold much before requiring emptying.  With cats fur and litter it fills quickly.  It does pick up litter.  You won’t have the expense of all those bags with litter cats throw out.  It does well on floors but not as well on carpet. I still use my name brand new expensive upright on carpet for best clean.  I use my German made canister on floors and dusting.  This I use for in between in bathroom and around foster kittens’ litter throwing contests! It has another problem. The floor attachment locks up and I have to pound it so it drops to meet the floor.

    I’d give this a e.t star if I could. This works great on carpet and well on floors. My huge issue is that it is a pain in the ass to empty. Let me start by saying that I dump the debris from my vacuums/sweepers in the garbage bin outside to prevent dust from getting on the floor. This vacuum makes it very difficult to do this. Not only does the top half of the vacuum have to be removed in order to empty it but the cord is also attached. When I empty to debris I have to carry the top half of the vacuum along with the cord outside. It wouldn’t be too bad if the cord was attached but it is and it’s annoying.

    This tool is ideal for vacuuming our small, rock living area.  And it easily lays flat for reaching under the sofa. Unfortunately, it's useless as a hand held vac for our car.  Simply not enough suction.  If you have a small space, it's a great vacuum.  But, if you wanted to use all the spiffy tools they include, you'll likely find it without enough power.

    I'm a little disappointed.  I didn't want to spend as much to get a dyson, so I tried this.  I was considering returning it but it'll do.The added parts - there are many which is nice, but I don't know where to store them all.  I'll probably rarely use them as it's not convenient for me to store the bag and then dig through it.  Not a big issue, but just my preference....I like the onboard extras of other vacuums I've owned.Balance - it's very top heavy, so standing it up is difficult.  Plus I get a little tired pushing it around.  I'm used to the bottom floor piece being heavier, so again, not what I was expecting.Emptying - it's a little awkward, again because of the balance.  After a few tries, I now understand I need to empty it in a lower trash bag.  I cannot pick it up to empty in my tall kitchen garbage.  I wish the cup removed completely instead of needing to tip the whole unit over to empty.Side sweeping - my dyson canister and uprights that i've had even sucks up around the side.  This machine only gets what is directly in front of it.  It's fine but not as efficient.Overall it's fine for my second floor quick clean so I don't have to lug the canister vacuum up.  It was not enough to clean my whole downstairs without emptying a few times...plus it took much longer.

    i had a Miele prior, and lost it in my house fire, so my limited funds to replace led me to a Shark. i've had this for 2 years - the chord! can we talk about the awful chord? it is all knotted and twisted- it is a mess. i have to go to a local vacuum repair shop to replace it. i wrap the chord around the chord holders, and i do nothing out of the ordinary with the vacuum except use it. in addition, the front cover over the filters keeps popping off while i use it, so i had to duck tape it in place. i should have saved my money up and bought a Miele.

    Top heavy and difficult to use for someone with weak hands unless being used on floor. I bought it for its light weight and for dusting ceiling, furniture, stairs, hardwood floors. Also you have to check which accessories come with it. You just can't look at the picture.  It worked well enough on my hardwood floors and the brush underneath was simple to remove and clean.

    Ok I love it. I am a custodian with a highly demanding area. I can hang this on my cart vacuum just anything and anywhere. Love it! But realizing that the way I use thus wonderfully built vacuum I will need replacement parts. That is a bid problem because the brush bar alone is almost what I paid for the whole unit with all the attacbments. So it will only last as long as the brush bar lasts.

    1. Top heavy (7 pounds or so) with the motor being at the handle. If you're not real strong, it's an adjustment.2. This also means it won't stand upright by itself.3. For me, it's tricky emptying the dust cup (the release button is on the bottom. I have to hold the vacuum with one hand, push the release with one finger while pulling the lid down with another.4. I like cleaning the dust cup after use but it doesn't detach from the vacuum. I have to release the wand and brush from the motor so I can turn it over to wipe it out.I suggest taking a look at one in a local store to see if the above is as bothersome as for me. Yes, I would return it except for the hassle of doing so.Pro - it has very good suction and nice long cord.

    This vacuum worked well for about a year, after that random things started to break, most recently the plastic tabs that hold the waste canister together.  I cannot use the vacuum now because mid use the canister just falls off and everything I have swept up falls all over the floor. The suction is good but the quality isn't so hot.  You will have to replace after a year or two.

I still find myself going over the same area of carpet 3 times just to get the visibly bouncing junk to vacuum up.

    I love how this vacuum cleaner operates on the steps.  It also vacuums doormats and cow hide rugs with ease along with Persian rugs.  It has a super long cord which is great for doing a two-story home.  It can grab insects in hard to reach places like above a curtain or a window.  The suction capability is great but this vacuum is very top heavy and cumbersome to handle.  If you do not balance this on an object while you are cleaning, it will fall down with a loud crash and you can damage it and it was not cheap.  It is not quite as light as it looks and I am disappointed that I have spent the past 30 minutes trying to register my purchase and I cannot find the serial number nor the model number on their web site and I am an educated person.  Most people will give up on the registration, which will be good for Shark when it comes to replacements.I set up an account and even photographed the box and the Shark label. Apparently you have to take the dirt canister off and then find the serial number behind that.  Mine does not have one that I can see because Shark has placed the sticker below the line of sight behind the plastic casing.  It is almost as if they do not want you to make a warranty claim, which give me pause.  They have an extended warranty of I think five years, but if you cannot find the label to register it, forget about it! I am sure if you have a problem they will not help you with a replacement without the serial number.  I am too frustrated right now.  I will wait until Monday and call them and let you know how it goes.  This is NOT a user friendly appliance by any means.

    Its a great vac for those who want something that is light and easy to move from floor to floor but here are some issues:For all the reviews which say, ""It just stopped working"" i'll bet it the electrical cord connection at the top of the vac.  When you wind the cord on the bail, it pulls the cord down at an abrupt angle.  This eventually broke the electrical connection where it enters the vac on our machine.  Additionally, the thing doesn't stand on its own and cannot be propped up unless the bottom is wedged into something.  Otherwise, it'll just roll out from under the head unit and come crashing down.  Finally, the bin is in a difficult place to empty it without making a mess.  While the vacuum seems to be weak, it really picks up a lot of stuff!

    Pros: it has good suction power, I love you get two cleaning heads one for carpet one for hardwood, they are easy to change just push a button to remove to replace click into place. The extra long cord is great, as are the attachments with a nice storage bag.Cons: I have a huge blister between my thumb and index finger because the handle has a very rough knobby piece of rubber on the handle, it would be great if it were smooth. It is top heavy, it will not stand by itself you must lean it on something or lay it on the floor. You cannot unplug the cord to empty the dust cup I have to gather the cord to take it outside to garbage can.It says lightweight but I am a senior and it seems really heavy to me.

    Nothing worse than a review from someone who has owned a product a week, right? Well, I've had this over a year and feel I can confidently address it's strengths and weaknesses according to my usage.Pros:-Light-weight-Maneuvers well, especially tight spots-Small foot print for storage-Plenty of attachments-Extra long cord (really like this)-Easy and flexible configurations.Cons:-Worked much better in the first few months-Small compartment (mixed feeling on this, see below)-Stuff gets caught up in the suction areas fairly easily. requires some maintenance, but usually not too bad-Some of attachments don't work that greatOverall, this is a decent vacuum *for what I paid for it*, which was at the time like 150 dollars when they were going pretty consistently for $200.In my humble opinion, $89-189, you're still in the mostly the budget vacuum arena and should have your expectations set accordingly.I hate nothing worse than emptying out one of the standard vacuums that end up with a huge amount of dust in the air and all over you. So while some have complain the dust compartment is a bit small, I actually see the compartment needing to emptied more frequently as a good thing. It  keeps me honest. And it's really not that much of a inconvenience, especially the way it has the really long chord and snaps apart so easily. I can usually get right to the garbage without having to unplug it.I have a long haired dog and golden and it does a decent job getting hair out of the area rugs. Out of the box, it worked great. I have not really used it *that* much in a year, I am not one of those people who uses it every day. But it doesn't work as well as it used to and I have broken the thing down to clean the brush and other parts few times. My experience is even with the expensive vacuums this becomes an issue at times, and at least it's easy to do on the Shark.The attachments that included are neat, but they only work ok. With the rotating brush, this thing did pretty well relative to it's size and price. However, when I use some of the other attachments, it's not that impressive. In my experience, the cob webs in the corner of your ceiling or on the fan, it's much quicker and less frustrating to use an extended swiffer than it is to try to vacuum them with the shark. It's almost as it you don't get the suction head over every single piece of the cob web, it's not going to do a great job (I think like a lot of you, I expect that it I get over and part of a cob web it would suck the whole thing down like a shop vac. It doesn't. Bummer, because using it for stuff like that or cleaning ceiling fans was a pretty big draw for me.I've also used the detailing brushes and was excited to use this clean the tough spots in my car like air vents and in certain little cracks. I think I only tried it twice and was simply not that impressed with it to the point of almost making it seem pointless. As I am writing this, I am almost wanting to go try it again to make sure I didn't do something wrong adjusting the air flow or do something differently, but that fact remains that I was pretty unimpressed with it.In closing, I don't think you're going to go wrong buying this vacuum, especially now that is appears be down to about $140. I used it as my one and only vacuum at this point and don't have any serious complaints. If you are expecting that all the configuration options and attachments are going to forever change the way you clean, you might be disappointed... I was. But overall, I am satisfied with the purchase.

    I asked for this for Christmas. We have a Dyson but I have Swiffer vac'ed the kitchen & entry for years and was sick & tired of the Swiffer not holding a charge long enough to do this basic job. The shark rocket is not my favorite cleaning tool but it's not a terrible purchase either.The pros - it picks up a LOT of dirt & dog hair. It is easy to dump the canister. It has a really long cord. It's great for using on stairs.The cons - it is very top heavy and too lightweight on the bottom. So after a while my arm aches from holding up the motor. And the bottom flops around some because it has no weight to it. It will not stand up on its own; you have to lean it against something or lay it down. It doesn't do my small kitchen rugs well at all. If it's on ""bare floors,"" it sucks up the rug. If it's on ""carpet,"" it doesn't do a good job of picking up the dirt.We have had it for almost 3 months and every single time I use it, I think ""I need to write a review of this product"" because the way it is top heavy drives me bananas

    This vacuum was great when it worked but it unraveled a small section of our carpet, which got stuck in the roller. This immediately overheated and melted, fusing the plastic together. I could not remove the roller after it cooled. I’m afraid that if we hadn’t shut it off it would’ve caught fire because of how much plastic just melted and fused. I took it apart myself thinking I could detach the roller but it was literally melted into one piece with the frame. I liked the vacuum but I could never recommend a fire risk like that.

    After seeing the commercial for the shark rocket I decided to purchase from the shark website. It comes with about 8 attachments. There's a bare floor attachment, attachments for your car, upholstery ( which I use weekly and love it) The attachments are great I just wish they were longer to reach higher surfaces. As for the vacuum itself it is very flimsy. It does not sit up right. It comes with a wall mount. And, you drill the wall mount and set the vacuum on the mount. The dirt cup is very small so after every time you vacuum you must empty the cup. I do like the fact that with  press of the button the dirt comes right out. After I empty the dirt cup I like to rinse the cup with hot water. Since the cord is hooked up to the top of the vacuum where the cup is I have to rinse out the canister with the cord attached which is annoying. Also, I find myself having to sweep my carpet before I vacuum. Anything can get this vacuum clogged. I found myself taking apart the vacuum all the time to get little piece's of paper or plastic which was causing the blockage of dust from getting into the canister. Also, there is no hepa filter. I think I will try to get a rotator lift-away. This is just not for heavy duty carpet cleaning.

    This vacuum cleans well, but for the price I expected more. It is extremely top heavy and due to this I find it difficult to keep the base solidly on the ground when I'm vacuuming. In addition, I did not realize that the vacuum would not stand up on its own. This is frustrating when you are mid vacuuming and need to stop to move items around, as you have to find a wall to rest it on. I don't know why this wasn't obvious to me when I purchased this item. However, I do love all of the attachments it comes with and have found those really useful! Overall, I was drawn to this because of its unique design and good reviews but will probably return it for a traditional vacuum.

    I'm going to be honest- you're not going to like this as much as a Dyson. But I couldn't personally justify spending hundreds of dollars more on a Dyson since I was already buying loads for my new home. It works fine, the cord is ample. But I just don't get that feeling of it really engaging with the floor when I use it- with a Dyson (I had one before I moved continents) you felt it was totally in touch with the floor surface and didn't miss anything.

    Finally that horrible swiffer vac died, it took forever to charge and its run time was a joke, I went on the hunt for a stick vac.  I subscribed to consumer reports to save myself from that horrible feeling of getting ripped off! I bought this and I am not really sure why I still have it.  I like it so much. Its my favorite color orange and it is so easy and fun to take it off to use the wand part to clean corners ect... I haven't used the detail cleaning portion, ironically it was a huge selling point. I want to clean every crevice of my car with it!This doesn't do really well on bare floors.  There is an attachement with a cloth and that works well but it won't stand on it.  The cloth is washeable but it only includes one, but I still have swiffer cloths I need to get rid of. I am using the carpet attachment as a stand, the only way it will stand, with the bare floor right beside it so its taking up more space than I anticipated in my small pantry.  It has a hook, so that you can hang it up, which is what I planned on doing so that I could use it to quickly clean the kitchen and living room, but the cord isn't long enough to hang it up where I wanted too and the handle is too big and it won't fit. I have another place to try, but Its not by an outlet. The real issue with the cord though, is that in order to take the handle off of the stand part, which you have to in order to use it, you have to take all the cord off, which then you have to wrap all of the cord back around again when your done.  Its just not practical unless its attached to the wall so beware of that.  My regular vacuum has attachements to clean the furniture, but I like using this one because it has a lot of attachements and does a good job on the dog bed.

    I bought this product over a year ago from QVC.  I will begin with the Pros:  Great suction, easy to clean filter and other parts, like the rotating brush.  Cons:  Top heavy - cannot stand on its own, always has to be supported; emptying the dust container is inconvenient as the whole motor compartment at the top has to taken off vacuum (then the stick part can stand on its own!) which entails the cord still being attached; does not catch everything on a floor without carpet because the brush continues to roll even though its not activated; even though its convenient for dislodging attachments for additional cleaning, I find I have to dislodge all the time in order to get dirt out of corners and to pick up what the vacuum head leaves behind.  It also took me about two weeks of using to get used to controlling the swivel on the head (or whatever it is called).As with all Shark products I have owned in the past it is good.  We own a Navigator Lift Away for our cabin and we both prefer it.  I will be buying this product and giving the other to friends or family.

    I wanted to like this vacuum and I did for a year. It worked well, worked for some hard to reach places, etc. After about a year of good performance, the vacuum has lost a ton of its suction. I get this isn't the most expensive vacuum but I was really hoping for more than 12-18 months before it stopped working.

    I got this because I wanted a light weight vacuum that could get underneath furniture. While it is capable of maneuvering underneath a lot, the top part is very heavy and almost pulls your arm along with it. Also, because the canister is at the top, the heat is right there by your hand and blows in your face. There areno attachment holders on the vacuum itself so you need to have your gadget bag handy which is also an inconvenience.  Vacuum works well but not what I was looking for in an overall package.

    I'm surprised that there aren't more negative reviews of this vacuum. There are definitely BIG design flaws going on here. First off, let me say that I previously owned a Shark upright which worked well for 2-3 yrs.until the hose attachment kept getting rips in it & the hose is a MUST for me to use daily because I have a lot of pets & have to vacuum the couches daily, etc. I decided to try this Shark upright instead because it has a long stick as opposed to a hose, which would eliminate my hose tearing issues. The suction is good on this, & it runs quieter than any other vacuum I have ever owned (which is very nice), & the cord is long (which I love). It also has a nice low profile head, so you can get under couches easily. It comes with a few attachments as well. Now, here's what I DON'T like about it: It is totally top heavy & very uncomfortable to hold after a few minutes, making it pretty uncomfortable to vacuum for an extended amount of time. I am in decent shape & don't have arthritis or anything like that & this thing almost hurts my wrist. Somehow the handle is not very ergo & could definitely be shaped better for grabbing. The bottom head is extremely light. Too light in my opinion, as the whole thing seems very off balanced & awkward as you use it. As you vacuum a hard floor the head is sort of all over the place because it is so light & it's not easy to control. If it had a little bit of weight on the bottom wheels, it would perform much better. As you go back & forth on a hard surface the head can flip back & forth & bobble around. It cannot not stand up on it's own (even with the head locked), which is a horrible design flaw! So you have to hold it with one arm when plugging or unplugging it, or set it on the floor. Unless you want to put the wall mount up (included) to store it by hanging it, you have to remove the dust cup/handle portion completely & hook it onto the bottom (because it won't stand on its own). This is not too big of a deal EXCEPT this means you HAVE TO empty the dust cup every time you vacuum first, because if you don't all the contents of the dustcup fall onto the floor because the dustcup/hangle part only hooks onto the bottom portion in a position where the hole of the dustcup (that clicks into the long tube) faces DOWNWARD & there is no cap to close off the hole! I found this out the first time using it. Everything just dumped onto the floor, so I had to put it all together again to vacuum the mess back up! TOTALLY LAME! Why would anyone design it this way? The dust cup is also very small in comparison to a regular vacuum cleaner. It's more the size of a dustbuster or something. This means you'll be stopping to empty it frequently if you are doing several rooms & you have to detach it & drag the cord along with you to the trashcan. Overall, I can't see this being a very practical vacuum long term to use on a whole house. It's just too awkward to use. Shark REALLY needs to revamp this design to be more user friendly & weighted properly. I am seriously considering returning it. I had high hopes for this vacuum, but it's pretty disappointing overall. I'm thinking maybe I should have just bought another Shark upright canister vacuum instead.

    So, I have had my Rocket for about 8 months and here's my thoughts. Yes, the suction is good. But to maintain that suction you will need to clean the filters much more then once a month, No, I don't live in a dust bowl. In fact I'm a little anal about keeping the house clean. We do have a dog that sheds often but nothing out of the ordinary. The dust bin fills quick and you will be emptying it often. This could be looked at as either a bad or good thing since it does do its job. The unit will pick up deep dust but can't seem to pick up a piece of string on carpet. Strange... If I could improve the design, I would make the cord designed to disconnect off the back of the motor. You will be emptying it often and every time you do you will need to unplug the long cord, wrap it all up to carry it out to empty. While emptying, you will most likely drop the wound up cord only to have to gather it up again to bring back in. May not sound like much of an issue. Did i mention that you will be emptying it often?  The unit is ideal for an apartment or small bungalow. But for any average size house I would recommend a full size upright with Dyson technology. No, OI don't work for Dyson. I'm just a geek vacuum guy who owns both. (my wife loves me) The suction head is quite small so if you are using it for  an average size bedroom, it's going to be like using a kids crayon to paint a wall with all the strokes needed to cover the area. Another issue i found is, the conical screen in the middle of the dust bin clogs up quickly. Not sure where they came up with the theory that it never looses suction. Once any hair or debris swirls around the center screen, the suction quickly diminishes requiring it to again be emptied and cleaned of. You will know when the air becomes restricted because you will hear a change in the sound of the unit where the air exits out the rear. A great vacuum for a small apartment or vacation home. If I had the money I would buy a Kirby and never look at buying another vacuum again. There ya go! More info about a Shark then you ever wanted!Follow Up:It's been a year and a half and no longer do I use my Shark. After two brush belts, and having to tote a paper bag around like a Wino to empty it every time I vacuum more than 10 square feet, I gave it away to my son for his studio apt. If you own a fairly large house, and you want the best, don't compromise, Go Kirby!

    I’ve had two of these now and the cord coming out of the top, bends at an angle that causes it to break. Both of mine have a short in the cord. The second one was a gift. I would not have bought a second unless they fix this issue. Other wise it’s a pretty good vac.

    Just received the Rocket.  Let me say it lives up to its performance.  However, it may be light weight, but it is ergonomically very difficult to use.  I am older and thought the light weight would be perfect.  Every time I use it I end up with a backache because all the weight is at the top of the machine.  I would not recommend to anyone who doesn't have good upper body strength ,

    It's ok. Not worth $200. Probably worth about $39.95. Doesn't go under much. Head is too thick and there's a big backwards hook for storage sticking out which means it's going to tear your mattresses and ottomans underneath.  Be careful. Kinda cheapy and toy like. How much do you have to pay for a vacuum to get a headlight?  Cleans well if you keep all the filters clean and what a big mess to empty. The hinged dirt cup thing assures dirt goes everywhere when you open it. The hinged cup design is all backasswards. So get ready to vacuum up the vacuum dirt. The cup is a mess to clean as it collects dust and can't be washed but must be wiped out intricately. It loses tons of suction as the 3 filters get dirty and must be washed frequently. I can't get through the house with proper suction unless I stop to wash the sponge filter. I bought it to do stairs and for that I'm thankful. Otherwise it's back to my Kenmore canister. It has a light and was only $120.

    I have owned this vacuum for about five months. It has pros and cons, but truth be told, I would not buy it again.Pros:  It does a good job on regular carpeting and most throw rugs.  It has a very long cord.  It is compact. It is easier to vacuum the stairways with its compact size.Cons: While it is somewhat lightweight, I find that my arm gets very tired after about twenty minutes of use.  The dust cup is small and cannot be emptied without taking the whole top part of the vacuum with you to the trash can (trailing the cord behind you).  I don''t find it to be very good on my hard floors as it rarely picks up the pine needles that are tracked in from the forest floor where we live.  I also find it is much louder than my previous vacuum.All in all, I would never purchase it again and would return it if possible.

    Great for carpet...terrible for hard wood and laminate floors. We got this to replace a Dyson animal was tired of dragging that big monster around this one was so much lighter... but it will not stand up on its own you have to either lean  it up against the wall or lay it down on the floor... I knew that going in reading the reviews but it's much more of a pain when you actually have it. It works beautifully on carpet but terrible on hardwood floors.  When we first got it we lived in a home that had mostly carpeting but recently moved to a home that has mostly hardwood and laminate... it's terrible on those types of floor barely picks up anything and actually can do some scratching if you're not careful. So now since it's been a few months we can't return it.  If you have hardwood floors and less carpeting you may want to find something else.

    I've waited a few months to write this review so I can really evaluate how well I like this vacuum. I use it on bare floors exclusively so the powerhead is useless for me which leads to my first issue. Since I only use the Dust Away Hardwood Floor Attachment it would be nice to stow away the powerhead and never have to take it out, however the hardwood floor attachment doesn't have a hook to wrap the cord around for storing which means I have to detach the hardwood floor attachment and reattach the powerhead every time I put it away and reverse the process every time I get it out. I took the powerhead to a friends house and tried it on their carpet and it does seem to work really well on carpet.I find this vacuum very top heavy and hard on my weak wrists. I thought using it over a few months might strengthen my wrists enough to make vacuuming less of a chore but that hasn't happened. A handle to hold onto on the wand would make it much easier to use in high places. It does have excellent maneuverability. The suction was a bit of a disappointment as it doesn't seem to have as much suction as my lightweight Bissell 3-in-1 vacuum. It's saving grace on my wood floors is the microfiber pad that picks up everything that isn't sucked up by the vacuum. Additional microfiber pads can be purchased at some bed & bath stores for much less than Rocket charges for them.The Car Detail Kit worked well to clean dust off my computer but the suction is cut down so much that I didn't find it all that useful for very much in my car.The dust bin is super easy to empty and I like that you can take the filter out and wash it.  The power cord is longer than any cord I've ever had on any previous vacuum and I love not having to unplug and replug constantly.
