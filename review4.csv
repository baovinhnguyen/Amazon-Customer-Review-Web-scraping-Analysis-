    It cleans dog hair off stairs really well and that's the reason I bought it, the only downside is having to empty the dust can three or four times for a flight of stairs.

    I just got this yesterday and so far am pleased. I bought this for touch up/quick cleanings in between vacuuming with my Kenmore canister vac. I only used it in the hallway and in our pet’s area and the dirt cup fills up fast. It is not too noisy but the blower is hot and blows on the users arm. Lightweight and easy to use. I like the smaller width of the beater brush for getting into smaller spaces. My only issue is the description said “dust away” attachment but it came with “hero” attachment which feels a little flimsy and is a little hard to maneuver.

    I have loved this vacuum.  I bought it last July, and it has worked great.  It has great suction and awesome versatility.  Today I found a large crack in the wheel that spins to clean carpet.  I had bought the extra warranty, so I called them.  They said a crack wasn't covered under the warranty.  I explained that it was used like a regular vacuum.  There was no reason for it to crack like that.  He said there was nothing he could do.  I looked on here and saw that Shark has a 5 year warranty on it's own.  I called them and no questions asked are sending me a new attachment head.  Wow!  Great customer service.  I gave 4 out of 5 starts due to the fact that the wheel broke, but I do still really love this vacuum.

    This vacuum is everything I hoped it would be and more. Light, easy to use and very efficient. The best part is being able to use the attachments to clean the car and the stairs. Being able to avoid using bags is a huge plus. I have had it for several months and no complaints yet. I have already recommended it to others.

    Does a great job on both floors and carpets, especially good with pet hair. The only down side is the top-heaviness of the design. Unlike most vacuums, this one cannot stand freely on its own but must be pulled apart if you need to stop working even momentarily.

    I loved the ease of this vacuum and the excellent suction but I found it was a bit awkward with the motor being up at the top.It just wasn't for me with the problems I have with my arthritic hands. I found it got heavy after using it for a while. Also when you stop vacuuming you have to lay it down somewhere because you cannot stand it up. On a positive note it had excellent tools and could reach easily under beds and furniture. I used this for a few weeks and was actually disappointed to send it back, it is a great vacuum. If I were younger and stronger I would have kept it.

    For the price you get a lot of vacuum and accessories for the money.  Lots of power to clean but I couldn't tell if there really was 2 speeds to the motor or not.  when I flip the switch for the other speed there is no change in the sound of the vacuum or the performance.  But the performance is more than enough for what I need.

    It took me months to decide which light weight vac to order.  I went to Lowe's and Walmart and gave them all a ""feel"".  You see, I've been attached to my 1958 Electrolux Gold and have dreaded giving it up. Yes, it's goldish-orange in color, just like our president.The motor still runs great, it cleans great, the darn cord retractor still works!  WHAT?  Why give it up?  This year it and I turn 59.  It's time for a change.  The hose is duct taped where it's split, there's electrical tape holding down a switch and the attachments all went to Canada after the election.  I have two wonderful ladies (they are US citizens, leave them alone) that clean for me twice a month.  The old girl ( the vac that is) is becoming a pain to haul out and lug around just to get up the day to day detritus.  PLUS we have recently added a puppy to our family.  I swanney his hair is more of a problem than Donald's.  So dog hair is a new addition to our collection.  At least I don't have to clean under the kitchen table after those sloppy grandkids leave.  That dog can lick a floor cleaner than Ms. Lewinsky can, well you get the picture.I looked at the cordless Dyson and when I saw I was only getting 6 minutes of run time for over $400.00 I might near fainted away.  At Lowe's I heft the full size models around a bit and realized it was more of the same old vac feeling there.Then I thought of Sir Elton!  You know, The Rocket Man! Elton John! and decided to reach for the moon.  Clean like a Ninja, Clean up like a great white tornado.I quickly unboxed and plugged in the Rocket.  It's a noisy little bugger.  I didn't hear two phone calls that I am sorry I missed.  I'll call you back tomorrow Rush!  It's strange having the weight of the machine in your hands and not at the floor attachment.  It requires more steering than a tiller fire engine on a back country road.  I honestly had to aim that sucker (pun intended) and concentrate on making sure I covered the whole floor.I'm sure I'll get accustomed to the new feel and it did clean well.  And even though it is corded the longer cord sure makes cleaning a lot easier.I'll let you know how my Shark is holding up after a month or so, but as of today I think I made the right choice.  Just going to take some time to adjust to all these new fangled attachments and still get it all done before the old man cuts on Fox News!  Oh wait maybe I'll run it during the show!!  ""What did Hannity say?  Can't hear over the new vacuum cleaner!""

    I like the light weight of the Shark Rocket. Easy to handle. Easy to clean up. Very powerful for such a small vacuum.Might be hard to hang on to for some people when using the highest power.  I would love it more if it were cordless with that much power.

    I just moved into a 2000 sqft home and needed a vacuum.  I bought this and was very impressed with it.  I vacuumed my new home for the first time and couldn't believe how much dirt and dust was sucked up by this thing!  I emptied the canister about 5 times before it was said and done.  I recommend this to everyone.Why I gave it four stars instead of five.  The people shipped it in its original packaging.  They didn't put it in another box, they just threw the sticker on the vacuum box and called it good.  I hate it when passers by can see exactly what I bought just sitting there on my front porch.  It only takes one person to steal your package! For paying $200.00 I would expect a little more discretion with the packaging.  On the upside nothing was damaged inside the box.

    This was recommended by my mother who had spend thousands on other high tech canisters to compare this to.Pros: The suction of this is impressive! If this used a bag, I would be angerly replacing them every couple times with the mounds of debris this collects.  It's a piece of cake to empty directly into the trash; not that I vacuum cake a lot either.The swivel head is super easy to maneuver around every obstacle.  The cord is a bit longer than the usual. The power head is very durable.  It does require normal maintenance cleaning hair and thread off the roller; sadly that hasn't changed.Cons: It does take some getting used to this being top-heavy.  The canister can become full and required emptying before finishing.  What can I say, I have a couple cats, a dog and three long haired humans that frequent the place!  I hate that this chore has now become enjoyable!
