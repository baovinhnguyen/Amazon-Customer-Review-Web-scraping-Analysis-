    very powerful suction.  picks up everything no need to go back and forth.  Very lightweight and easy to maneuver.  I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  Extra long chord lets user move away from plug receptacle.

    This vacuum works wonderfully from hard floors to deep carpet and the hose works well to get high and tight spaces. It is very powerful and can hold a lot of debris for its size which is good because you can vacuum for a while without having to stop to dump dirt so often. I use it for my 918 sq. ft. apartment and only have to dump it once or twice. I also love that it is so lightweight and compact enough to store anywhere without taking much space at all.

    I had been looking for a light weight broom/vacuum mainly for my kitchen area; this model seemed to fit the bill.  Am I surprised with this purchase??  YOU BET!!This little vacuum exceeds my expectations!  First, being able to take it apart and use just the handle part is great for using in the car, etc,  then, being able to disengage the floor attachment makes it great for baseboards, etc.Lastly, the BIGGEST surprise? It does better on my carpets than my $400. Dyson 16.  I am delighted to submit THIS review because it's well deserved.

    I don’t have any Carpet in my house only Tile and hardwood. I have been on a search for a good stick vacuum. This rocket works very well. I have had it for about 9 months now and it’s still going strong. The hero attachment works the best on my Hardwood floors. It’s is a low attachment which allows for dog hair to be sucked up easily.

    This product is amazing! It makes my life so much easier and every day I use it, I find myself exclaiming how glad I am that I bought it. My husband and I both work a lot and its great to have this product. I use it as my broom and to get rid of the dog hair my husky sheds!  The head swivels so its good for many hard to get areas and the easy way it disconnects makes getting into corners quick. This is very light so I don't really dread when I have to pull it out of any area to plug it in and use it. I keep it readily accessible so that seeing it will make the vacuuming happen more often. I can switch from getting the baseboards quickly to straight back to vacuuming.

    I've had this thing for about an hour so I can't comment too much on the durability or how long it'll last, but I spent a little too long cleaning my house the second I got it out of the box and it's everything I was looking for. It's very powerful with a strong suction and cleans carpet and wood floors both really nicely. I love all the attachments it came with, it makes it so easy to get into every little crevice. I used the nozzle attachment to go across the top of my baseboards and I couldn't believe how much dirt came off. I am so impressed and so far, would recommend it 100%. Keep in mind I'm coming from a cheap little 15 year old Bissel 3 in 1 stick vac, so pretty much anything would've been an improvement, but I'm seriously in love with this one!

    This vacuum is great! I decided to upgrade to this one from a $20 hunk of plastic from Walmart.It's got a multitude of different head attachments for all sorts of flooring and locations. I tried out the regular head and the crevice tool so far and am impressed with the suction and ease of emptying.I was specifically looking for a corded stick vacuum and this is exactly what I wanted, exceeds expectations for the price.

    I loved the Shark Rocket so much when I first got it in April of 2019 that I got rid of my other (very expensive) vacuum. Unfortunately it started having suction issues a few months later. However, I finally got around to calling Shark when the issue got too bad to use to vacuum in December, 2019. The customer service was excellent and they were eager to fix the problem. I'm currently awaiting the arrival of my unit (I paid for shipping, no other costs as it was still under warranty). I recommend the Shark Rocket for the unit and customer service availability.

    I had an older shark model that worked great but was just too heavy to lug up and downstairs and around the house. I dreaded using it. This model is extremely light and has good suction.  The con is that the vacuum head is small and it takes longer to cover more surface area.  To get the most from this vacuum, use the attachments.  Even though it takes me longer to vacuum, I'm not as tired.  I also had a dyson animal - the Shark Ultralight is a better product.

    Having searched, read reviews and listened to friends who own this Shark, I bought one for myself. I am a small woman with arthritis and like to keep a  clean home. This vacuum allows me to easily care for all rugs, hardwood floors and carpeted staircases. It moves easily and is light enough for me to work the stairs. The additional tools included have already been put to good use. The fact that it doesn't stand on its own was not a deal breaker for me as I do not mind resting it against a chair. Very happy with my purchase.

    I have all wood floors with a few small rugs. I bought the rocket with the rug attachment, but I don’t need it. The floor model works well on the small rugs. The rocket is so convenient, much faster than sweeping the floors. People complained that it doesn’t stand up, which I do not see as a problem. It lays down very easily, if needed. The swivel head makes it perfect on corners, under the couch and furniture.

    Wow, I have a Bissell vacuum that I just used 3 days ago on my living room carpet. I saw the commercials, researched a little bit and even though this one was not the top one, it was a good option and I am extremely impressed by this little fella. I just tested it in the carpet and to my surprise it got half full with dust, hair and dirt. Just 3 days ago I cleaned it with my older vacuum and this vacuum just showed me how little my old one was actually working. And all the details it has, the suction power is there, the flexibility, light, filters, easy to use. I'm just very impressed and glad that I got it and for only 120 on Black Friday. Great buy.

    Compact and lightweight powerhouse.  Unpacked the Rocket and running just a few minutes, assembly is easy and apparent without the included directions.  Just like the old time vacuum salesman I ran the Rocket over a thick throw rug recently cleaned with our old vacuum.  I was surprised by the large amount of dirt that was in the collection chamber.  This model came with the hardwood floor attachment, like a swipper, and it works well.One very minor caution, when assembling the beater head avoid the pinch point on inside of the flexible joint.Buy this thing, you will not be disappointed.

    Best vacuum I have ever owned.  Love the swivel head, extra long cord, easy to switch from bare floors to carpet and has great suction.  I also like the fact that it doesn't take up much space.  The only thing that is a bit cumbersome is emptying it.  You have to open the bin of course but you have to have the vacuum in a horizontal position.  I put a paper towel in the kitchen sink and open it there as I don't have a large garbage can in the house.

    I moved into a brand new apartment and the carpet already looked vacuumed and nice. I ordered this vacuum and just did a test run across my floor and the entire container immediately filled with dust and dirt I couldn’t believe because the carpet looked so nice and clean already. So of course I did my entire home, I feel better now knowing all off that dust and dirt is out of my carpet LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!! Getting my mom one for Mother’s Day

    I have owned this vacuum almost 3 years and I love it a lot. Suction power is great and you don't need to worry about losing power during cleaning like Dyson wireless ones. And it is super easy to clean tangled hair around the roller brush. Very well built and those attachments that came with products are very well designed.  Don't buy those rechargeable battery powered vacuum, I have owned a Dyson before and you have to change the batter every 1 or 2 years. Also filters are washable so you can use it again and again.

    I clean for a living and this tough little machine is my new best friend. Go under beds and heavy furniture and across different floor surfaces easily.  The microfiber pad on the hard floor attachment works on sandy floors. Its brush roll (when on motorized level II) might be a little too aggressive for some carpets. Wash the filter often for the most powerful suction.

    This is an awesome vacuum. I use to use, and love, my Mother's  Dyson ( over $400 item) until I purchased this.  Light weight, easy to assemble and use. Much easier to empty dust canister than the Dyson and actually cleans carpets better !  Great suction and rotates easily. Long cord, which worked better for me than the Dyson's wireless ( rechargeable battery) because I could only get thru 3 - 4 rooms and it would die.  This is a long cord and able to easily go thru rooms.Many accessories including those to clean car, which is nice.  Really happy with this product

    I have waited about 9 months to write this review. It's an awesome vacuum. Best house vacuum we have ever used. I have a few messy kids and live in a carpeted apartment.  we use this thing every day and with the proper care that is suggested, this thing is still as strong as when it was first used. Comes with a million attachments even for car detailing, which I havent used yet. But all the other attachments are real useful for those awkward angle places or below furniture. Great power and so far durability has kept up well!

    This vacuum works great on pet hair and is really versatile and easy to use. It is quite powerful despite being a small vacuum. Using attachments is a breeze as is going between floor and handheld mode. It works very well on bare floor. The fact that it doesn't stand on its own is a minor annoyance but I either lean it on something or take off the top and those options work fine. I use this as much with handheld attachments as in floor mode so the fact that it is so easy and effective to use the attachments is the main positive for me.

    Just finished vacuuming my house. 3 cats, lots of hair and currently battling flea infestation. So far, the best vacuum I have ever owned. No need to charge, light, picks up hair/cat litter/fleas lol like a champ! I was able to cut my vacuuming time in half as well. The attachments maneuver between furniture so well! I am finally able to vacuum under my couch without having to move the bed! Love it, buy it and enjoy it!

    Small, light, effective, and very maneuverable best describe this upright. It stores very neatly in our broom closet and gets used regularly in our kitchen, breakfast area, and utility room. We mostly use this vacuum for non-carpet areas of the floor and on furniture. We are blessed with two wonderful cats who seem to shed constantly so we must constantly follow up as faithful staff members should and vacuum up their fur deposits as required.We have not found it to be as effective as our Eureka upright on carpet but it has the advantage of a narrow width which permits us to get to places where the wider Eureka just can't fit. I see it as a perfect compliment to a larger upright for carpet and has the advantage of light weight and portability. With the attachments it is very easy to vacuum the furniture and has a really big weight and portability advantage as well.If your house has little carpet then it would probably do for the entire house with complete success.

    I have had a Dyson Pet Vacuum for the past 5 years and while it served it's purpose, I love the Shark Rocket.Entire vacuum is so light weight (motor is in handle, so top is a little heavy, but once you get used to it, you don't even notice).Cord is extra long.  I can plug it in downstairs and vacuum all the way to the top of the staircase, something I've never been able to do before.  Canister looks small, but trust me, it holds a lot (we have a yellow lab that never stops shedding).  Attachments are awesome.

    I couldn't wait to get this and vacuum for the first time.  I didn't 100% believe the commercial that showed how much stuff it would pick up on floors that were supposedly already clean... so, I vacuumed with my old vacuum, then vacuumed after with the Shark - so much gunk and dust.  I didn't know my floors were that dirty all the time!  I also did my whole minivan (3 kids under 5 in the back seat), which badly needed it.  The car detailing kit of attachments was great.  The hardwood floor attachment did a great job picking up the big stuff and dusting with the microfiber pad.  So happy with this purchase!

    I live in a small cabin. The rocket works great. Easy to use. Goes under and over beds, cabinets, chairs, sofas real easy. Say it is one of the best I've ever used. I do not find it too heavy. Much lighter than the old Kirby. Plug the power cord in the living area and was able to vacuum the entire home without removing it to another plug. Hung it on the wall in the utility room and it is out of the way. Hold on to it when turning it on, it could get away from you. You will not be disappointed, at all with any aspect of this vacuum.

    We have had this now for some time (6+ months) and has been best vacuum cleaner I have owned. Our home is mostly solid floors with some carpet and this thing really pulls the dirt and dust up even after using it for sometime now. Heck I even use it to clean our cars and it’s not neat at it but works fine. Comes with some attachments but we most use main one and one for hard floors but I like how can come apart to be smaller and more versatile.

    This thing honestly picks up so much but it seems to work better for us on our carpet than our linoleum.

It picks up their fur much better on carpet than it does on linoleum but it still gets it on linoleum and sucks it up

    It takes getting used to because the handle is top heavy but, after mastering that, the vacuum does an outstanding job.  We used it on a carpet that had been vacuumed regularly by traditional vacuum cleaners.  However, using this one picked up a whole bunch of stuff that the other one didn't get.

    I purchased this for my mother, as she wanted something lighter than her old vaccum. She was very delighted when she unwrapped this on christmas day. She has used it many times since, working well on the hardwood floors (as that is all she has in he house).CON: The only thing I did not like (More about the shipping ,) the Vaccum was shipped in the brown SHARK Vaccum box. I was at work when this came in and she seen what it was, so the initial Christmas surprise was lost. But she still loves the Vaccum itself.

It is stronger than my shop wet/dry vacuum.  Can't beat the price either.

    Delivered quickly. Lightweight, as promised. Dirt tray fills quickly with (months of, I'm embarrassed to say) German Shepherd, & the hair of 2 Beagles. Got this vacuum for the lightweight reach into those hard to reach corners, high & low & for the ""vaccu-dusting"" kit for the computer, &  have to say I'm impressed with the freedom with the cord length & didn't mind emptying the bagless bin frequently.I haven't used the carpet or hard floor tool as I live in a hoarder-esque (bordering on) household. We've got TONS of dog beds. but EVERY flat tabletop surface is STACKED with papers that fall on the floor. The SharShark's unique crevice tool allowed me to vacuum up the dogs' ""tumbleweeds"" that I would've gotten papers stuck to, avoiding the tumbleweeds comPLETEly, rendering vacuuming befofe the Shark completely futile.Proven so as of 2 weeks ago our _____ brand canister  vac, convertible from rotating floor for carpet to rollers off, to crevice & furniture tools, but to use those far away, it was heavy & lost suction.2 weeks ago, Mom'slittle 10 y/o Beagle named Peanut got an obstruction from eating all the hair that I couldn't get to without my Shark. I researched & the Shark was EXACTLY what I needed for reaching  past the dog beds & I am VERY happy  with the power to do my ceiling fans, cobwebs in the basement ceiling, etc., withOUT hurting myself!

    Owned this vacuum for about 8 months.  Looove it.  Despite it's lightweight, the little vacuum picked up considerable amount of debris each time I put it to work. Our new lab mix dog sheds so heavily that her white dog bed is covered with her brown fur after a while.  This morning I just ran the vacuum over her bed.  The bed is restored to its original white color with just a few passes and the dirt bin is full with dog fur.

    I really like this little Shark vacuum. It comes with a ton of attachments, you can hang it on the wall and it won’t fall or destroy the wall. It’s easy to clean, great for all types of flooring, and the suction is much stronger than you would expect from a lightweight vacuum. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats and the animal hair is everywhere and this vacuum is great at getting all the hair, dust and dirt from everywhere - floors, furniture, air ducts, and all the hard-to-reach places! Would definitely recommend this for everyday use. It was also very easy to assemble.

    We just received this vacuum cleaner so I can’t say anything about the durability but my wife is very satisfied with this new vacuum. We had a Dyson before but after 5years it didn’t work anymore. A repair shop wanted to have 150$ for a repair. So we decided to buy a new one. After reviewing most of the canister vacuums we wanted to try a new brand and also to safe some money. Therefore we tried the Shark Rocket Ultra light. Right after the first time of vacuuming our carpet, the container was full within two minutes. Looks like the Dyson we had before didn’t have the same suction. The vacuum runs almost by his own over all carpet and over hardwood floor. Very easy and very light. We are more then happy with this purchase and no need to spend a fortune on other brands. Our carpet looks perfect after using this vacuum.

    This little vacuum is excellent. I have a big house so was worried it wouldn’t be enough. The cylinder is a bit small, but it’s a good trade off to have a light weight, strong machine.

    This is the best vacuum me and my wife have ever used. Tested it against a very well known competitor by vacuuming the carpet with the very expensive vacuum. Then did it with the shark and was amazed at the dirt that filled the canister ! Did this with multiple rooms and had the same results. Not only is it light it is easy to clean the filters, disassembles easily and it is very light. The dirt collection canister fills up quickly, because it works so well. Only wish it was a little bigger.

    Very light and swivel like it’s no thing!Suction does not feel as strong thus hard to tell if it’s really picking up so much as the typical Shark pet hair specialized vacuume.Power gives two options to either carpet or hardwood floor with buch of replaceable attachments.  Stamd atraight against the wall is a good feature for storage, however I wish to feel more suction on hand (that’s how light it feels back and forth: this could be the both pros and cons).

    I was in love with this ultralight vacuum from first use. I raved to friends and family about it. Now that I have used it over the course of time, I can tell you that my love has not faded. I love that it is so light, so versatile, and so easy to maintain. The suction and the swivel head are amazing. You won't be disappointed, I promise. The only drawback - and it is minor for me, is that the motor for the vacuum is at the top, your wrist and arm will bear most of the weight (although it IS very light) and for any big cleaning, my wrist and arm can get a little fatigued, but nothing too bad. I can't recommend this vacuum enough.

    This vacuum works great on all surfaces. I use it on my hardwood floors and move right up onto carpeting. The swivel head takes care of the dust and dirt along mop boards and cupboards. Very easy to dump.

    This is my 2nd one.  I used my last one for 4 years in California.  Left it behind for the person who bought my house (hard wood floors).  I just got my new one.  Works great on tile and area rugs in my brand new home.

    Shark has really wowed me with this product. Includes mini car cleaning tools. I love it,except for 1 small minor annoyance? When you empty the dirt collection bin,the bin itself and extra long cord stays attached to the main unit. Other than that,buy it!

    I love this vacuum. After having a Shark upright for 6 years I switched to this when it went out. This thing has power and attachments galore. Having all hard wood floors the hardwood floor attachment is great. It is light weight and portable. The cord is so long I don't have to keep switching plugs all the time.

    I bought one of these for our dental office to replace our bulky upright that was tough to maneuver around chairs and had a hose attachment that just irritated me. This vacuum is so amazing I bought one to replace our Dyson Animal for our house. We have 2 Huskies and 2 small children so we spent $600 on the Dyson Animal and loved it. I was really hesitant to buy this thinking it was a cheap imitation of a Dyson that wouldn’t compare but if I had to choose between this and the Dyson, hands down the Shark Rocket would win. There are no annoying hoses to take out and put back, you can lay it flat on the ground to vacuum under things and the head is so low profile and articulating that I can get in and around things that I had to move before. It picks up dog hair and food just as good and actually does a better job on cleaning the hair out of my car. There are two settings, one for carpet and one for rugs and hardwoods, both are awesome. It comes with a gazillion attachments but I only need two to clean everything, the main brush head and the angle nozzle. It is 10 times lighter than a traditional upright and takes up a whole lot less space so it is easier to store. It doesn’t hold a lot of dirt and hair but because it is so easy to take out of the closet and empty I vacuum 3 times more so I end up having a cleaner house and I only have to empty it once. Worth every penny.

    I love this thing. I bought it because I had a crappy, cheap vacuum cleaner and I needed something that would work with carpets, hardwood floors, and upholstery. I live in an apartment, so I also needed something compact and that I could mount to the wall for storage. This thing is POWERFUL and does a great job at cleaning. I recently moved to my new apartment and the carpets are new, so I was having a sore throat. After vacuuming once with this thing I feel better. Highly recommend for apartment living.

    OMG...I know this sounds silly, but I LOVE this vacuum! I'm older and have some health issues. Due to limited storage space I had to keep my vacuum downstairs and my husband would have to carry it up for me and usually even do the vacuuming since it was such a beast to push  around the carpet. This vacuum is so small & light I hang it in the coat closet upstairs and its so easy for me to maneuver that I do all the floors (tile, berber & frisse`), plus using it for a mini-vac for small clean-ups like the fireplace hearth. The suction is much better than my upright! Also I got the ""mini-tools"" and cant believe how handy they are and how often we use them! My only regret is I didnt know about this years ago.

I love how comfortable it is in my hands, love the swivel head, love the long cord, and love the ease going from carpet to tile.  It really makes cat-hair hair-balls easy to catch and I do not mind emptying it more frequently than other vacuums.  Great suction too.

    This is the best vac I've ever owned. I was shocked at what it pulled out of my carpeting, and it can tackle kitty litter in one pass. I wish it had a larger dirt cup, but I don't mind having to empty it so often to get the amazing cleaning.I recommend ordering some extra filters along with it so you have them on hand.  Once they start to go, you loose a lot of suction.

    Sucks as strong as a shopvac by my judgement. Lightweight use, even after a major surgery I was able to use it even though I was supposed to be resting. The dustbin pops open quite aggressively so make sure you have the whole thing over and kind of inside the trash can before hitting the release button and dust explodes out. Rugs look brand new again! Easy to vacuum car trunk, again right after surgery.

    I made the right choice!, I had a dyson lightweight that broke down  unable to replace it bought this one as a more affordable option, great suction , excellent for bare floors, my house is 120 yrs old and there is a lot of crevices in the floor planks, it picked all the stuck dirt from it, great brush , I also have a cleaning roomba robot that wont be using after buying this shark one, it weights around 10 lb, it comes with all the attachments so you do not have to buy any extra ones, the filter is washable and the dusting piece is unbelievably effective, all the parts have a detachment button so there minimal pulling, so easy to change  parts, definitely a keeper, Im in love...

    This vacuum is sweet! Very powerful. The amount of dirt I pulled out of the carpet is incredible. I filled the collection cup 5 times in a 300 ft^2 living room. I was living in all of that! This is all dirt and dust that my old vacuum wasn't picking up. It is very lightweight, maneuverable and compact for easy storage and cleaning in tight spaces. Some people have complained about the dust cup being too small and not detaching from the rest of the vacuum. This doesn't bother me at all. I just detach the motor/handle and dump the cup into the garbage. People have also complained about the vacuum not standing up on its own. I either lean it up against something or detach the motor/handle and attach it towards the base of the vacuum and it stands up just fine. Most of the weight (which isn't much: 7.5 lbs) is in the top of the vacuum that's why it doesn't stand upright by itself when assembled. I'm amazed how such a tight and compact machine has so much power. I highly recommend this vacuum. Don't waste your money on a Dyson they are over priced and over rated (just because they advertise in a British accent doesn't make their vacuum more elegant or sophisticated). This vacuum is very sleek and operates very smoothly. The Rocket is where it's at!

    I don't write many reviews but this product has so far exceeded my expectations that I made an exception. I used this daily as I have an Anatolian Shepard who apparently has it in her DNA to shed constantly. The ease of use is amazing. As a note, initially it will appear to be heavier in the handle than expected. Once you use this for a time you'll understand the genius here. The added  handle weight is necessary for maneuverability and you quickly get used to it.  I would not be without this product. After 2 Dysons and numerous other vacuums, I find this to be the best of all of them.

    I am use to an electrolux - mine just died after 12 years.  I bought this to get me through until I decide on what vacuum to purchase next.  I love it!  I read some of the other reviews and yes, this does have a very long cord, but I have a large home so the long cord is a plus for me!  It is easy to switch from tile to carpet.  It's lightweight.  It does have to be emptied frequently which is as simple as pressing a button to lift the cover.  It takes longer to vacuum because the power head is small, but it does a great job and is easy to use on stairs.  I think for a minor con or two, there are far more pro's.

    So far so good.  I don't have much to add that hasn't already been covered.  This is the first and only product I've ever actually ordered because I sat through a late night infomercial (or three) for said product.  It just seemed like it would really be exactly what we needed in our new home.  Our house is almost entirely bare travertine tile.  So our big, heavy traditional canister vacuum designed for carpet and pet hair just isn't appropriate here.Unboxing was fine.  I was up and running to show it off to my mom-in-law in no time.  I got it hung on the wall in our utility room with no problems, though I wish they did include more hooks, or maybe even an organized attachments caddy to hang so I don't just throw everything in the included bag.  Good cord management would be a nice add as well.In the trial runs, it handled the tile perfectly.  My bare feet picked up no dust or grit after a pass with the Rocket.  It also did a fine job on a new cotton & jute rug, pulling up all the loose fibers and such before they could spread all over the house.Suction is good.  Maneuverability is good, if not a little loose.  The plastics don't feel altogether durable, but I do expect it will last a while.  It's a vacuum after all; it doesn't exactly get abused.I like that it is lightweight and maneuverable; that it has a nice, long cord; that it hangs out of the way on the wall; that it handles bare floors better and easier than sweeping & swiffering; and that it's easy to empty and clean.I wish it stood upright on its own; that the bare floor attachment had a cord hook like the carpet head does; and...well I guess that's about it.I got the one with the little car kit and such since it was the cheapest on sale.  But I don't know when I'll actually use that.  Pretty nice little set of tools if you ever so want to get into the cracks & crevices, I suppose.

    This is my second Shark.  Both work perfectly, and I find changing the attachments easy as well as dumping out the dirt cup and washing the sponge filter.  The Rocket is easier to move about when I am using the crevice tool in corners and along the baseboards.  The longer cord means fewer times I need to move the plug as I go from room to room.  Also, it's shorter width fits into smaller spaces and under furniture without any difficulty.  The price was right and I'm very happy that I purchased another Shark.

    This is the best designed and easiest to use vacuum I have had. It's light, can be configured different ways with attachments, goes under beds and some furniture, and has a swivel head to reach everywhere. A favorite feature is the lever to adjust from bare floor to carpet is changed with your thumb, right near where you hold to use. No more constantly bending down to adjust on other uprights. Thank you Shark. If I built a vacuum, this would be it.

    I bought this for my daughter because she has two small children and always seemed to be lugging around a vacuum and not getting anything picked up really. She says it's the BEST gift she ever received. *beams*  It is so light for one, that I, with a bad back and being unable to vacuum for years with the usual models can do it without being in pain. It lets you stand upright which is  awesome . It came with just the right number of attachments, She is thrilled to get into all the little nooks and crannies under stoves and around corners and up high at the fans..etc etc.Turning it into a hand vac is so easy and she has a townhouse with two sets of stairs so it makes it so much easier to keep them clean. Also she got into her car with the attachment and was amazed at getting into all those tight spaces the kids will drop things into. The filter is awesome and she loves seeing it fill up because as she says,"" I'm getting it cleaned, not just pushing stuff around.""I recommend this to everyone but especially people that have trouble bending over while vacuuming. Best money I ever spent!

    Owned this for a little over a month, it's exactly what we need in our condo, we have 2 flights of stairs and the way this detaches makes it VERY easy to traverse.  Even if we had a much larger home I would still want one of these just for handling the stairs as lugging a full vacuum up and down quickly turns into a workout, and doesn't allow you to get into the nooks and crannies so easily.It does come with cheap plastic drywall anchors, if you're mounting on drywall I highly suggest you buy metal spring toggles that pop out beyond the wall to ensure it is held securely.  I double recommend metal toggles if you've never attempted to use plastic anchors.  Or just find a stud!

    I did a lot of research before ordering a vacuum because my needs were very specific. I wanted a machine that was lightweight, powerful, good on stairs, adaptable for hard surfaces and easy to empty. This model fills the bill! I have used canister types for stairs before, but I hate pulling the vacuum around around behind me. The swivel head is great, also. I was concerned that the top part might be heavy or awkward, but it's fine. I'm 68 and hate vacuuming so this is a Godsend! It got a very high rating on Consumer Reports as well.

    I always thought my expensive Kirby vacuum cleaned my carpets well until I decided to try the shark. I went over my carpet with the Kirby then with the shark. It was amazing. I had to dump the canister multiple times as it was full of dog hair, dirt and grime. Even now when I vacuum I still get so much junk in the canister. My carpets look clean and fluffy. I wish I had bought this product sooner. The pict is the junk thr shark picked up that the Kirby didn't. Gross !!

    Got one as a gift. Average suction, love all the tools that came with it great for stairs, furniture and computers, like that you can get under beds with it. What I don't like is as others state, won't stand on it's own, tiny dirt cup so must be emptied frequently, so not for anyone with carpet or large areas to clean and after 1 month of use the discharge door on the dirt cup broke off when I emptied it. The clear plastic hinges are an epic fail. Now I use a plastic coffee stirrer to hold the dirt cup discharge door on. Can't recommend until this design flaw is fixed. *** Update called to complain got a shipping label and a new vacuum, got to keep my accessories! I think they still need to use a stronger plastic for the discharge door hinges though. Shouldn't break that easily when emptying.

    Bought this vacuum July 2019 and it is now a little over 3 months later. Our house is roughly 1200 square feet and mostly carpet except for the kitchen which is laminate. We vacuum roughly once a week or every other week. Oh and not to mention we have a two story home, so we needed something lightweight to carry up the stairs AND to vacuum the stair which are carpet as well. (FYI we do NOT own any pets). This is our one and only vacuum, not a supplement for quick cleaning. There are too many things to love about this vacuum. The suction quality is excellent. I have to empty the container at least 3 times during a full house cleaning and I like seeing all the dust and dirt that it picks up. It is a bagless vacuum which I like also.  It has one deeper suction setting for carpet and a lighter one for hardwood. It comes with a brush for carpet and a smoother head for the hard wood. It weighs a mere 8 pounds so lugging it up and down the steps is not a problem. It does not stand up on it's own which I read was a complaint from other purchasers but that does not bother me that much. It props against a wall just fine. I also like that it works well on our rugs. For maintenance, be sure to cut the hairs that get strangled around the brush head. This can cause tension on your vacuum which causes It to wear out sooner.

    Impressed by the power. Lightweight. Seems well built. Doesn't hold much; you'll need to empty it often. Quiet.

    I thought there was no such thing as a reliable vacuum cleaner. Then I bought my Shark Rocket. This thing is outstanding. So light weight, so powerful, easy to clean. Highly recommend for small spaces or if you have trouble heavy lifting. It’s got this great motor that pushes the vacuum with no effort on your part. Bends and turns great. Tucks away easily in a corner or closet. Highly recommend!

    I researched and chose this Shark rocket because I have a Dyson D35, which is an excellent floor and rug sweeper for quick clean-ups (Much better than Swivel Sweeper or Oreck). I like the easy emptying feature of the Dyson as opposed to my old bag vacuum. The Shark Rocket is fantastic! I couldn't believe the amount of rug fiber it sucked up from just the first 10 square feet of vacuuming. This thing really sucks, in such a good way. All the included attachments are a very well thought-out bonus, but none attach to the Rocket, so get a basket or bin to place nearby. In the #2 position for rugs, it self-propels. So, I wouldn't recommend spending the extra $100.00 for the self-propelled model. This HV302 does just fine.

    I did a lot of research and reading on this item before purchasing it so I could be well informed about it and the competitors version.  I love the Shark Rocket Slim Vac.  It is more powerful than my Dyson Pet Upright Vacuum, easier to get up high without a lot of fuss and I can get under the beds without having to disconnect and connect to other parts.  It is lightweight and maneuvers easily around and under everything.  I do have to empty the dust cup after each room I clean but then I had to empty the dirt on my Dyson pretty often too, so that does not bother me.  I love the long cord, I can reach just about the whole house from on plug in.  I highly recommend this product....

    I have a Kirby vacuum and I HATE to pull it out because it's heavy, awkward and frustrating to use. I recently moved to a two story apartment and wanted something lightweight and easy to use on my second floor. I also needed something my 7 year old could use so he can help with chores.I have fairly clean house even with two boys and two labs. If you don't know anything about lab hair the important thing is, it's wirey, coarse and sticks to EVERYTHING! If you know nothing about kids know this, they are messy little creatures. Thankfully mine aren't too terrible but they have their moments.Anyway, back on topic, this little vacuum cleans like nobody's business! I have included pictures of what it pulls out of the horrible Berber carpet on a weekly basis. These pictures are from an average week. We vacuum at least once a week. (In case you were considering dogs and kids, now you know what they can do in a week in a clean freak's house). The picture of the bag is what it pulled from a hallway, bathroom (yes, I use it to clean kitchen and bathroom floors too), and my tiny bedroom. We live in northeast Florida so my dogs seem to always be shedding. The picture of the vacuum open is how much it pulled up from my small living room, dining room and kitchen. It does not lose suction even when full unless it has blockage. I have run this after running the Kirby and it still finds something to pull out of the carpet. Sometimes that IS the carpet itself. I have taken to using it on both floors now because it's so much easier to use. I keep the Kirby for nostalgia.The pros:It stores nicely in the wall.It is easy to dislodge stuff.It definitely is lightweight.It cleans very well.The cord is a decent length. Can go from top of stairs to bottom and about 8 more feet or so.The power switch is close to vacuuming hand for the cons below.The rolling brush comes out easily. Also applies to cons below.The cons:DO NOT let this thing anywhere near a carpet snag with the brush on. There will be a small fight followed by some cursing and lots of pulling up of the carpet.DO NOT let this near the dogs tail with the brush on. The dogs don't forget. EVER.DO NOT let this near anything that can possibly be pulled in by said brush roll; like string, edges of blankets, jacket sleeve, towels, etc.I did not get these attachments so I cannot comment on them. I did get the hard floor one that I never use. The upholstery brush is so-so. Kirby's is better. The soft brush in use from time to time. Mostly for my AC vents.

    I absolutely love this little vacuum.  Saw the infomercial and wanted it.  Resisted & did some reasearch first and decided to get it at a box store (with a 20% off coupon) just in case i wanted to return it. Plus, i wanted it that day.  So brought it home, snapped it together and vacuumed away.  Now I can't stop vacuuming.  I vacuumed my bedroom carpet, shocked at what came out.  Did it again then vacuumed w/ my dyson.  Something smaller than what i'd call a dust ball was pulled up with the dyson. Did the opposite in my daughter's room (dyson first, followed with this shark) and wow... kicking myself for spending so much on the dyson now. The shark is very powerful. It propels forward by its self but you do have to give it a tug to pull it back.  I've been using it so much, i've been joking i might build up a muscle in my right arm.  The cup is small but so easy to dump so i'll take that over a big one anyday.  It does kinda stink that it doesn't stand up on its own but I've gotten into the habit of detaching the top and sticking it in the holder when i want to walk away.  now it's habit and don't give it much thought.  Easy to remove the bottom to get either the top, bottom or even a chair. cleaning the stairs is amazing. Love the dust pad attachment.  bye bye swiffer vac. Just came on here to find a 2nd duster pad so i can alternate until 1 gets through the wash.  To summarize, great vacuum, good price, fully recommend.

    Just started using this vacuum, and it works great. It has powerful suction and the  rotating brush is veryeffective. And this was very affordable. I don't understand why some people complain about howto empty the waste canister, it takes 2 seconds and requires no effort. I'm a happy customer.

    I have a really nice Dyson as my main vacuum, but I also have 3 floors to cover and lugging the big vacuum up and down is quite cumbersome.  I bought this Shark Rocket to just keep on the top floor and am finding that I love it so much, it's wandering all over the house with me for quick clean up jobs.  It's an incredibly cool device and very well engineered.  It goes together in 2 clicks out of the box and it's just as easy to convert it to a hand vac and boy do I  now appreciate the power of a CORDED hand vac.  I have been using cordless ones for many years and you maybe get 10 minutes (maybe) or solid vacuum time before a recharge is needed.  The power head on the hand vac is great for bedspreads or sofa cushions.  I'm in love!!  The only thing missing that I quickly ordered was a flex hose for use when in hand vac mode.  It's so much easier to maneuver into crevices with a flex hose.  Hose HVFH320 is the model that fits on this vacuum.  In summary, this wouldn't ever be the main vacuum for a large house because the dust bin is just too small, but it works well for everything else you can think of.  Lightweight, great suction and superbly versatile--this machine rocks!!!

    I did not buy this on Amazon, BUT, I am reviewing it anyway. I love this little guy!  I live in the dustiest house ever, and I vacuum every other day. Before my first use, I vacuumed with our Bissell. Then I tried this guy out. Wow! I could not believe how much dust was still left in my carpet!  There are two settings, one for bare floors amd another for carpet. The cord isn't a self rewind cord, and at first I thought it was inconvenient. But really, it takes no time at all to wind, and it stores easily away. It takes up half the space of my old vacuum and does twice the work. I'll take it!!

    I just picked this bad boy up from our local Walmart for my elderly mother. What can I say? I came home and had it together in a matter of minutes. I plugged it in and turned it on and - whoah! The vacuum pushes itself. I had my mother give it a try and she liked the fact that it assisted her in the push for clean up. It's not too heavy for me, but my mother did state it was a bit heavy for her when she lifted. Either way, it's still MUCH lighter than any other vacuum. In fact, I think the cord weighs more than the unit...lol.As for the suction, this thing picked up years of dirt in one go. I'm so happy with the purchase! So much cheaper than the other name brand!

    2nd review on 6/22/2020: I figured out how to attach the vacuum portion to the bottom. That said, the cord is slightly shorter than the one from my original vacuum model and the floor tool is slightly smaller. But these aren't game changers. So I'm happy now.Old review on 6/21/2020:I expected to see a bottom attachment on the vacuum that allows me to store the vacuum in a stand-up position.  Instead, I received a sweeper attachment that does not ... I needed this vacuum asap(Father's day). I received it. The color is the same which is fine... Otherwise, the quality of the vacuum is fine.

    The Shark Rocket may not look like a muscle machine capable of doing a heavy job but I assure you that it excels in almost every way. I have had my machine over six years and it is still working at top performance.  It is amazingly easy to maneuver, has a long cord that follows me without getting under my feet through my one floor home ( hate to have to constantly unplug and replug the cord!). I never leave my vac standing on it's own unless it is running and rarely then.  The power head is easily activated.  This particular brand is supposed to do both hardwood and carpeting, but one has to use a separate filter for hardwood floors, and I do not like to have to change things around so I rarely use it.  The suction is equal to or greater than larger vacs until the debris cup fills. This machine  breaks down in three different ways to use.  The head detaches from the wand for a small hand-held, or one can leave the wands on to have reach because they detach from the power head and the obvious of all 3 parts together.Having said all of these wonderful things, I notice that Shark has a new model vac quite similar to this one (Shark Ultra Deluxe Pro) that has a hard floor genie and even a pet head that slip on easily ( both sold separately but does not fit Rocket Ultra).The Deluxe offers is a flexible wand too. This vac sells for about the same price, it is just the options that cost more. The Deluxe Pro has a larger collection cup than the above Rocket, which would be nice. I find that  It is awkward to clean the  debris cup of my Rocket without getting dirt and debris all over, and it fills too quickly for my  needs. I hate having to spill the collection cup all over so I use my mini shop vac to clean it and then empty that bag, and I am not certain there is any difference with the Pro.  So, I am going to purchase the  Pro when I decide to purchase a replacement or backup for mine,  primarily because I want the hard-floor genie, the pet brush and the larger debris cup.I found this new model when I was shopping to purchase another of the advertised one so I would not be without one should my first one break. I was pleased to note the improvements so my next purchase will be the Pro, but one would certainly not go wrong with this item. It is so much easier, and even fun compared to any other vacuum I have used.  It almost does the work itself! I have had more back surgeries than a person ought to endure and this little machine sure makes it easy for me to use without xtra pain. Want to buy your loved one (even a guy) something fun and useful for the holidays?  Then check these models out.  The price accrues in proportion to the accessories, so start slow and add on depending on your need for accessories.  I bought all of them with my initial purchase and have not used ay of them, so determine your needs before you spend!NOTE: I purchased this unit from Shark, before they were available on Amazon but both Shark and Amazon has great pricing but do not buy from Shark unless on sale (Shark has good sales, especially during Black Friday) actually unless you have to, why not buy everything on sale!  NJoy this great machine/s~

    Man this thing is one powerful suction machine! I had the choice between this and like over 100 other vacuums and wanted to try this form factor, and haven't looked back. Yes! It's top heavy. With that said, once you adjust to it, it stops mattering. It propels forward fairly easily on brush mode, it sucks extremely well. It doesn't come with any attachments which is the only downside in my opinion.. a simple 2 dollar extension like the higher end models would have made this perfect. Luckily I bought one and installed on on my own to make my set perfect. (Called up Shark, and they sent it my way)The dyson's are comparable to these but I'd rather not have to charge yet another battery.. got enough power tools already. Note: I paid $100 for this.

    Okay I am going to make sure and cover all the bases with this here vacuum. I live in a dessert. I have four kids, a cat and two dogs (including a husky). I have a need for a good vacuum.current vacuum- Shark Rotator professionalreplacing it with- Shark Rocket HV302Why am I replacing Shark Rotator-Well for one, The Shark Rotator is big and bulky, heavy and not sturdy when upright. I always feel like it will fall on my toddler or smash my toes. Stairs are a nightmare to vacuum with it. And frankly I am just not impressed with the Rotator...AT ALL. It has proven to be my least favorite between the navigator, rotator and rocket. The plastic rubber part on the handle started to peel off within a week of use. I find it cheaply made and wobbly and the power cord is short!Positives about the Shark Rocket-Lightweight, multi-use and I purchased my Vacuum from BB&B with a 20% of coupon and paid 160$ that's right 40$ off the amazon price of 199$ and if I didn't like it or an issue should arise I can return it hassle and shipping free!! This little vacuum has Power and suction like my upright Rotator, but is way lighter and came with a TON of basic and extra attachments!! Including a car detailing kit that is seriously freaking awesome and a neat hard floor dust away attachment, which is dually awesome. The stairs are so much easier to do now and I can hit everything from, hard tile floors, all carpet types, wall corners to stairs, blinds and the car using ONE system! Its power cord is long so I do not have to re plug it so often. It also has a wall mount attachment so you can hang this bad boy up and out of the way!Some slight ( But not deal breaker) annoyances-In using this little Rocket I noticed a few things that would do well to be tweaked in the future if possible.1.) Top heavy- To be expected, the unit motor itself is heavier (but this whole vacuum weighs no more than 8lbs) than the bottom vacuum part, so your arm gets a slight work out from holding it up. but the motor does give it that ""propel forward"" feel so it doesn't bother me one bit, plus my arms will look great in a few weeks after use.2.)The dumping canister is attached to the wire that plugs into the wall and does not detach on its own. Which mean you have to haul the whole motor over to the garbage and dump it. Which sucks because sometimes I like to give the canister a good washing every now and again and now I cant for fear of getting electric gear damaged, but I just use a wash cloth and wipe away access dust and dirt into the garbage. NO biggie.3.) Obviously this thing doesn't stand upright on its own...DURRRR (top heavy). However find a wall ( as long as your on carpet it works) and lean against it. It has rubber no slide grips on the bottom part of the motor so it stays put pretty well. It also comes with a wall mount so you can hang it up.All the issues to me are not really issues, there to be excepted with a machine like this ( except for the canister issue...come on Shark people, pull your selves together. you won't get best vacuum again with this type of canister)! Other than those three minor issue, this Vacuum literally can and does do it all! I am very happy to replace my Shark Rotator with this beast of a lightweight vacuum!Again, Bed, bath and beyond + 20% coupon (when you get mail news letter from them) = 40$ off 199=160$ you CAN NOT beat that price!!Thank you for reading!

    We purchased this vacuum to replace a traditional Bissell vacuum with a floor attachment that had broken years ago (6 year old vacuum).  We have primarily wood floors with freize carpet in our bedrooms and a shag area rug.My floors were becoming a daily battle with two young children and crumbs, so we decided to give this a try.  I have been able to pick up with 1-2 passes: chips, paper, dirt, dog hair, small rocks, any food crumbs, dried water beads, amongst other daily messes.  I empty the canister daily after using the regular attachment on my hardwoods and a shag area rug.  The cord is plenty long for me to reach my great room and I know it will not lose suction or power having a cord instead of being cordless.  I appreciate the rubber on the back side of the motor that helps this vacuum stand up against the wall since it is so top heavy.  At the current moment in time, I haven't decided where to store this, but we leave it in our great room plugged in for quick pickups, I truly love this vacuum.  The only thing that would improve it is a self winding cord and being a few pounds lighter (like the Dyson stick vac- but, I'll take a corded over cordless ANY day).The negative was getting used to this type of vacuum- it is so top heavy that my arm felt more strained than I felt it should and with the tiniest flick of the wrist the head would swivel.  My floors get dirty- and using the ""dust mop"" attachment is not enough, I NEED a floor cleaner such a Bona with it.  I chose this vacuum because it wasn't a vacuum steamer (which can damage wood floors) but I could ""mop"" and vacuum at once.  I sprayed the floor in sections and passed over it without any problems.  The quick mist of liquid did not hinder the vacuum from picking up debris and my floors shone after.  This however- was a major workout with a wet pad dragged behind the vacuum.  As another reviewer said, when you use the dust mop attachment, you must go in perfect strips or you will pull debris back to you, so push forward and pull back in the same line.  This took some getting used to, but I was still done in half the time of my old vacuum and then dust mopping after.  We are thrilled.I have owned this for 4 days and have used it more than 10 times.  With my old vacuum, I'd use it once a week- maybe.

    I needed to write a review here, even though I bought mine at a club for less, because the reviews really helped me to make up my mind!  So I have been using the Rocket for about 6 weeks now, and I have to say that it's made vacuuming fun again!!  I don't have to lug around my clunky 50lb vacuum (which broke just before I bought the Rocket, incidentally) and the amount of dirt and pet hair that it pulls out of the rug (I'm filling the cannister 2 or 3 times doing just one carpet once a week) it's alternately thrilling and horrifying!  I cannot believe that we lived with that amount of dirt for the past 5 years (we rent a house), but I am so glad to have found this cleaner.  It's lightweight, it goes pretty far around the house (including up the stairs) and I can vacuum the bed and furniture with only a couple of snaps!  My husband has a dust mite allergy, so this is a great feature for us.  I cannot recommend this product more highly.

    This is an awesome vacuum because it is not heavy.  Yes, the attachments have to be stored somewhere else, but that makes the vacuum lighter.  Plus, when you vacuum the attachments are not falling off everywhere.  It is also easy to transform so that you can use the attachments to reach higher places like the corner of a room.  I like the two speeds.  The one for hardwood floors works great because the vacuum does not just blow the dust around.  Other vacuums which do not have to suction options will just blow dust on the floor before you can pick the dust up.  It is perfect for stairs.  I really don't understand the bad reviews.  Buy this vacuum!

    This is the second shark rocket vacuum I have purchased. This recent purchase came with an attachment that is wonderful for tile floors,  which was a nice surprise!  That was the only flaw I felt in the original one, although it had a bare floor setting, it did not work well enough. This attachment solves that.  The only negative I noticed in this newer model was that  a light no longer shines from the front of the vacuum while you're using it.  This was very helpful in preventing me from vacuuming up small Lego pieces and other small items.  I've owned my original for several years with no problems. I only bought a second, as we've moved to a much larger home and I wanted to have one dedicated for upstairs. Great versatile vacuum, especially the feature that allows you to make the vacuum more compact for stairs.

    I put this vacuum to a test against some of the other brands and Shark stood out above the rest like Hoover, Dyson, Eureeka and Bissell. First of all the suction is amazing at sucking up everything that was left behind other vacuums. It is similar to Dyson but I believe performs better at suction. Its real easy to maneuver around, easy to reach under furniture, bed, great suction on floors and since canister is on top by the handle it is real easy to remove and empty. Its not as heavy as other vacuums and I feel that canister being on top takes the pressure away from your back and your arm gets a good work out. Usually other vacuums caused me a back ache since I had to push them around and they were close to 20 pounds. Rocket is light and puts the weight on your arm not back making it easy to move around. For me great suction is a must on my vacuum since I have allergies and I need to have dust and allergens removed from surfaces. This vacuum fits the bill pretty well. It is also easy to maintain and empty. I highly recommend this model to anyone.

    I was in the market to replace my 6 year old Dirt Devil Stick that I had purchased on black friday for $8.That vacuum was one of the best basic ones I had ever had.It was now time to replace it due to a glitter incident that made it spray out glitter everytime I had used it.I was a little hesitant to spend so much on a vacuum but it was still less than a $500 Dyson.I got it on deal at Best Buy for $160 and am in love with this thing.It is so light and so powerful! All the attachments are so well built and durable. The main shaft that dust travels through is metal and so durable so that way debris does not scrape the inside causing hair and dust to get stuck on.All I can say is that this is the best cleaning device I have ever had the pleasure of owning.Terrific, just plain terrific!!!!!!!

    My home is over 2,700 square feet of tile and laminate flooring with several x-large area rugs.  This vacuums outperforms the Kenmore canister ball-and-chain I been lugging behind me for a couple of years.  I dreaded vacuuming the house so my husband was the one having to do this evil chore. I just felt that no matter how much I passed the vacuum over the tile grout, small pieces of dirt were left behind.  I bought the Shark Robot and was amazed how much dirt came out of the rugs.  I vacuumed the whole house and had to empty the dust reservoir more than 10 times!  The next time I vacuumed with the Robot, I just had to empty it 3 times.I think this vacuum would be perfect if the dust reservoir was detachable so I could wash it. In addition, the vacuum includes a floor tool which has a microfiber pad.  I do not like it at all.  The microfiber makes me feel that it traps dirt or sand and might scratch my floors. I wish it was more like the one offered by Dyson so I could use it without fear of scratching my floors.

    I love my Rocket!!! It’s getting old I had mine over7 years now, so it’s time to upgrade. If you purchase this machine directly from the manufacturer, you should not have a problem. I have learned that people return things to the store stating there’s nothing wrong with it when they’ve actually broke it.You have to do your homework just like when I was at Walmart I need an antifreeze, I purchased a bottle got it home and it was all water. Because I failed to takeoff the lid to see if the seal was broken. Please do your homework

    This was a Christmas gift off of my wish list.  It's not light as a feather, but it is light weight.  The suction is amazing!  It's made some of my older rugs look like brand new.  Other vacuums had left so much dirt there, but this think forced the dirt out.  Sure the can fill up fast, it's small, but it's so easy to empty it, so no big deal.  It also comes with lots of accessories to clean pretty much anything.So far I've only vacuumed the stairs and the normal living areas.  Soon however I will start putting all those accessories into play.If you are trying to decide between this and the much more expensive Dysons, I would go with this.  It is NOT cordless, but let's face it, batteries lose juice too fast, and charge cords get lost.I'm now a devoted Shark lover.

    My hands and arms are not very strong, I have tendinitis in both yet I have no trouble pushing this thing around on my hard floors or area rugs. It easily gets around corners, under furniture, and in tight places, I just love the swivel base. The cord is 30 feet long, I love that feature and I also love that the attachments are so easy to put on and take off, no tugging needed which is a problem that I have come across with other vacs. I gave this vac 5 stars because I really don't think there is another on the market that is so versatile and has as good suction for this price. I have a Hoover Windtunnel upright, a Eureka canister, an Oreck upright, a Dirt Devil corded stick vac, a Roomba, and a Eureka cordless stick, I am happy with all of them in one way or another but if I could keep only one vac it would be this Shark because it does it all. I admit after reading reviews about how top-heavy it is I was a little worried. When I use it on hard floors or area rugs I have no trouble at all but If I had to use it to vacuum things up high constantly I could see where it would get heavy. I also read that it is awkward to carry it to the trash to empty because the whole cord has to go with you, well I just empty it when I pass the trash in the kitchen or on the porch, it's a no brainer. I noticed that the unfavorable reviews I have seen are mostly from men, I looked at other retailers websites and read reviews and decided that because I am a woman, I would pay more attention to what the women say. I love this thing, I have no complaints, it's a keeper!

    I purchase many items on Amazon, and rarely write reviews, but this vacuum deserved a review! First things first, go buy one! I did quite a bit of research, and decided that this fit my needs the best (carpet, area rug, 2 sets of stairs, all the attachments, compact and lightweight, and powerful). My wife had just vacuumed the week before the Shark Rocket arrived. I unboxed it and vacuumed just one landing stair. It picked up more on that one stair than our old vacuum probably picked up in the entire house! I have only had this vacuum for a short period of time, but I absolutely love it! It cleans our carpets well, and I have used it for cleaning other surfaces, cleaning the dust under our refrigerator, etc. Best vacuum ever!

    I bought this a few months ago and I am so happy I did. It is so easy to use and it can go into small spaces where others can't. An advice in using: let your arm hang down all the way as you vacume instead of holding it high up as you would a regular vacume cleaner, otherwise your arm will tire quickly. If you have problems with your arm or wrist, this would not be a good choice because it does require some holding. Although it is light. you do need to hold some weight, unlike regular uprights. Some people have complained that you can not detach the canister from the cord when emptying, but I say so what? It's no big deal to pull the cord along. Most homes have or should have a waste basket in every room so it's not a problem. Two things that I do complain about are that the plastic housing on the bottom portion of the canister is shaped in a way that it has a elongated curved tip at the end and this constantly catches my clothing as I am moving it back and forth. I don't know why the engineers had to give it such an odd shape like this. It should have been rounded so it doesn't catch any clothes a person is wearing. Obviously they don't do any vacuuming themselves. The other issue is that the plastic cover over the filter at the end of the housing is flimsy. I always have to watch it because it falls off easily and you can loose it if you don't watch it. You'd think that the designers would pay attention to these kinds of details. A good product like this should not have these kinds of design flaws. All in all I would buy it again. I now actually enjoy vacuming and look forward to it and that is saying a lot! You wont regret it if you buy it.

    I just received the 301 version of the Shark Rocket Ultralight--I believe the only difference is in accessories:  this one does not come with the micro vacuum accessory kit, something I already have and find of little utility or value.  But it does come with the other attachments, and I found a really, really good deal on Amazon.  Others have found the need to compare this vac with the Dyson, and in fact, I already have the cordless Dyson Digital and the Dyson DC25.  Notwithstanding how Dyson may have marketed the cordless Digital model, it is only good for quick clean up and the version I have only has the turbo driven brushes--so it is not capable of deep cleaning of carpet.  What that Dyson presents is a really good version of the original Black and Decker Dustbuster. Comparing the Dyson DC25 and the Shark Rocket becomes a little more challenging.  I suspect the Dyson might be more capable of deep cleaning carpet because it has more weight on the brushes.  Dollar for dollar, I would conclude, though, that the Shark is a better value because it can be purchased for half or less than half of what the DC25 costs.  Where I find the Shark excels is on carpeted stairs, and that's the reason I purchased the Shark.  I have searched for years for a vacuum that can ergonomically and efficiently vacuum stairs, and the Shark Rocket Ultra is the ONLY vacuum that I can recommend to vacuum carpeted stairs.  Heretofore, I used a handheld, corded rotating brush Dirt Devil, and while that method worked, it took forever to complete the task.  I can now vacuum the stairs in one third of the time as compared with the Dirt Devil, and with less effort on my part.  The Dyson DC25 is incapable of vacuuming the stairs with the motorized head.  Try to stand the DC 25 up on stairs, and it immediately disengages the rotating brushes.  If you are on a tight budget, the Shark Rocket Ultralight 301 / 302 would do a good job keeping your carpets, tiled and hardwood floors clean.  However, as others have pointed out here, in the process more of the weight of the vacuum will rest on your wrist.  But for stairs and getting underneath beds and most furniture, the Shark gives a really long reach.  In my opinion, the Shark excels for those tasks.  I would certainly purchase it again but will use it mostly for stairs and not the carpeted floors where I will use the Dyson DC25 and Miele.

    I purchased this vacuum at a bigger store on their Black Friday sale due to reviews I read here. I am so happy I did! This vacuum is amazing! It’s compact but doesn’t fall short on power! It’s easy to maneuver and can fit in tight places! My house is mostly hardwood with a small carpeted area in the entertainment room, with carpeted stairs and a large rug upstairs and this vacuum was perfect for the job! I highly recommend it to anyone needing a compact but more powerful vacuum than your typical uprights.

    Having used big, clunky traditional vacuum cleaners all my life, I was interested in finding something with a more compact design that was more aesthetically pleasing but also performed well.Like many, I was unwilling to drop the cash on a Dyson, which was an attractive designed cleaner that had great maneuverability and performance. A little research, thanks to Amazon and YouTube reviews showed that this model was the perfect alternative to more expensive models and purportedly had similar, or better, performance.Now, I've never actually used a Dyson, but after using this vacuum for only a few short minutes has me never wanting to try anything else!Firstly, right out of the box this assembles quickly and everything is pretty self explanatory. The rubber grips feel comfortable in my hand and really makes this feel overall high quality when held.The pivoting head works AMAZING! Such a headache relief from old style vacuum cleaners. With the powerful suction, this puppy almost pulls itself and maneuvers around furniture like a dream. The low design of the head gets under furniture better than anything I've used before, too!Comes with all the attachment accessories that are pretty standard for vacuums and the hard floor sweeper head is a nice addition to everything.I haven't filled the chamber yet, so how messy disposing of its full contents is still a wait-and-see situation. Hopefully it won't be very messy.Overall, beautiful product, works perfect and is priced very generously. For my apartment with lots of furniture populating space, this vacuum is absolutely perfect!

    I work for a large retailer who also sells appliances.  We have both DYSON and SHARKS - and use the display models int he store all the time, so I'm familiar with both product lines.I bought this rocket because I knew it was a great product, and the sale was undeniable (165.00).  When I brought it home, I vacuumed my 3x5 rug in the laundry room... it didn't *LOOK* dirty... OMWORD, i got over 1 cup of dirt from that rug.  >GROSS<  The motor/drive has a strong pull, it's wonderful for carpet.  Yes, the cup is small - no big deal.  It's incredibly easy to clean - and remove pet fur.  I have a super fluffy cat and a yellow lab...  This machine, with the floor dusting pad, cleaned my entire downstairs hardwoods while picking up all the fur/dirt/etc.  I'm so tired of using a dust mop and then vacuuming up the mess - this gets it all in one pass.  I love that this vacuum gets RIGHT UP TO THE TRIM along the bottom of the wall.  It's not terribly noisy, the 30' cord is perfect...  I'm definitely a happy camper.  OH!  There's also a car detail kit available for 20.00 - guess what my next Amazon order will be... ;)

    I have two cats with a combination of hardwood, tile and carpet in my house.  I needed a vacuum that worked effectively on all surfaces, including carpeted stairs.  A couple years ago, I invested in a Dyson Animal.  It worked great on the carpet and had a hard surface attachment for the hose that worked really well on my hardwoods and tile as well.  It also came with a couple of other attachments that I thought just might do the trick on the stairs.  Well, a couple months ago, I finally got tired of lugging the thing up and down the stairs and none of the attachments really worked well to clean the stairs, so I was in the market for a stick vacuum.  I turned first to the Dyson, but wanted to branch out and see if there were any other options out there.  I saw the infomercial for this vacuum, and for the first time in my life actually ordered something based on that!  I got the upgraded package that includes all of the attachments, including the AAAA-MAAAZING under-appliance attachment.  This thing is great!  I've had it now for about 6 months and I couldn't be more pleased.  It has amazing suction and I actually think it picks up more out of my carpet than the Dyson did.  It is perfectly simple to empty and clean the filters.  It's light enough that I don't mind carrying it up the stairs.  And the head is just the right size to run it on the stairs, so they get just as clean as the rest!  Ok, I have to admit I have one small complaint.  The microfiber cloth on the hard-surface attachment means that it only has vacuum sucking action on the forward stroke, so you do have to kinda employ a double-stroke strategy.  But, that one thing does not detract from my overall satisfaction with this product.  A warning - the carpet attachment has a smaller footprint than a standard vacuum.  If you have large open areas to vacuum, it will seem a daunting task.  However, as strange as it sounds, this thing is kinda self-propelled and I find that I can vacuum my whole house in about 20-30 minutes.  Love it!

    I'd say that I am a vacuum connoisseur. I love vacuuming & previous to owning this Shark Rocket I had a dyson. Typically my vacuum's last me from 5-7 years so when the Dyson quit after 2.5 I wasn't going back. The Shark caught my eye because of all the attachments and the style of vacuum. I hate heavy vacuum's that are hard to maneuver.Pros:Tons of attachmentsYou can hook up the main portion with the head and no long tube to create a hand held vacuum that is full power. (how I do my sofa daily)Power!!! I vacuumed after my dyson and I filled the tank.Easy to emptyLightweightAMAZING priceReusable, easy to clean filtersDurableAmazing Suction (I have accidentally vacuumed a corner of a blanket and the vacuum proceeds to suck it all up until I hit the power button.)Cons:I wish the tank was removable so I could bleach it.

    I replaced my 10 year old Eureka full-size vacuum with this little beauty about a month ago and now I find myself actually enjoying vacuuming! I tell my husband all the time how much I love my new toy. It's so light and easy to maneuver, unlike my old beast which cause me to break into a sweat just from pushing it around the house. It's super powerful by my standards and gets even the finest of dust out of our rugs. We have hardwood floors so I wanted something that would go from hard floors to area rugs with ease and this definitely meets the requirement. I am able to clean all the floors in my house (including the tiled kitchen bathrooms) just using the main spin brush, but of course if I switch to the attachment with the microfiber pad I can get my wood floors even cleaner. Sometimes I'm too lazy to switch the attachment; not that it's hard--so much easier than a full size. You don't even need to bend down since you can pick up the whole thing with one hand.  I use the upholstery attachment to clean the cat hair off the furniture and it works like a charm, and the crevice attachment is nice and long so it makes cleaning up the corners a breeze (again, no bending or getting on your knees).I have two minor complaints, and the first is a common one about the size of the waste canister or whatever it's called. If I'm cleaning the whole house I need to empty it 2-3 times, but it really is quick and easy and I think I prefer emptying a little container regularly rather than the big canister like I had on my old machine that I a) always let get way too full and stinky, and b) always caused a mess when I dumped it. Besides, it's not like it could be much bigger without making the whole vacuum completely awkward, but for people that have really big or really dirty houses this issue may become a big problem. The second complaint is that I don't like that it doesn't come with a hose attachment. I went to vacuum my car and found myself wishing I had a hose so I could get in and out of the tight spaces easier. I'm sure I can purchase a hose separately, so I can solve that problem if it continues to bother me.

    I'm just the average user who buys many different things.  So when I write a review on here I'm giving you just the average users opinion so in the end I hope my reviews help you all when buying any of the products that I have purchased.  I bought this product through Khols and not on Amazon.  Its the exact same package however if you keep an eye out for deals you might be able to find this for a little cheaper.  I saved about $40 by buying this through Khols and not here.  However the deal I used is no longer going on there so this would now be the cheaper of the two.  That being said onto the review.  This product is awesome and comes with a ton of great attachments.  I have had both Dyson's and Hoover vacuums in the past.  Hoover just seemed real poor quality and the tubes kept coming apart although it did have amazing suction.  The Dyson I spent an arm and leg on and was a great vacuum cleaner.  However this one being cheaper has better suction and performance then both.  The amount of dirt and dog hair I get out of my carpets is almost gross.  I didn't realize I was living in such a dirty world.  I really though my Hoover Windtunnel was doing the job.  Well it was not.  This thing is light and goes pretty much anywhere.  It breaks down into a small handheld which is great for doing steps.  There is only two issues you have to consider when buying this vacuum.  1. The canister is really small so depending on the size area you are vacuuming you might have to empty it a few times.  Not a big deal but still something to consider.  and 2.  The canister doesn't remove from the power cord.  So every time you go to dump the canister the cord is coming with you which is a pain if you're vacuuming an area that is not within cord distance to the garbage can.  Thats it in my opinion.  The suction power is beyond incredible and you'll be amazed at how much you're getting out of your carpet.  If you have dogs (I have two) you'll be amazed at the amount of hair you'll pull up out of the carpet and furniture.  Of course the amount of dog hair during shedding season is where the small canister and cord not detaching from the canister became and issue.  Fills up with dog hair quick and had to make frequent runs to the garbage can to empty it.  Either way I don't think you can go wrong with this vacuum.  The issues I've listed are ones to consider but in no means a reason why you shouldn't buy this vacuum and is why I still gave this product a 5 star rating.  I hope this helps.

    I had talked to my wife about getting a Shark vac to replace our bulky Dyson upright but with so many different models couldn't decide on which one.  I so this model at the exchange store at the VA hospital. The price was so low I decided to give it a try. I've had spinal fusion and needed something light to use. Best vacuum I've ever used.Its suction is powerful and it glides across the carpet. Incredible maneuverability and can get under chairs,beds and tight spaces. It is quite versatile. Very happy I bought it.

    We recently moved into a 3-story townhouse and the middle floor is all hardwood and tile so our heavy carpet vacuum would have to be carried up and down the steps to be used on the top and bottom levels. Plus, it is awkward, at best, to be used on the stairs. So, my husband researched stick vacuums and we decided on this model. It is awesome. It is quick to change, very light, and easily maneuvered. My husband especially likes all the little gadgets for cleaning small parts, including our computer keyboards and his car. It is very easily emptied and has filters that can be rinsed under running water - saves tremendously on filters and bags. We hesitated because it is corded and we wanted a battery-operated model, but the cord is long and because we don't have to pay attention to how long we have it on, we can vacuum all levels without having to plug it in to be recharged. Another great feature is the bracket for hanging. He put the bracket on the wall just inside the door to our garage. It is quick to access and stays out of the way. Our other vacuum almost needed a room for itself.

    I received this vacuum last year as a Christmas gift and I love it! So light weight yet picks up everything. I have two dogs and one cat, pet hair home no more. I have used the vacuum just about every day and have had no problems. I previously owned a Dyson which is a bigger unit and works fine but has sat in the spare room since last Christmas, this unit is just so much easier to use on a daily basis. Would definitely recommend. I just purchased one for my daughter for Christmas.

    I very highly recommend this vac.I've owned it for 3 weeks now,and love the job it does.We bought it before seeing the infomercial and went by reviews on the web.It really does pick up dirt left behind by our old canister vac.I've had cordless vac in the past,and before long,they stop fully charging,and you usually can't put a new battery in them.This vac has a 32' cord,so it can go a long way before switching outlets.The top end is a bit heavy.That's where the motor is,so the ladies might have a problem with that.Also the attachments not provided like the under appliance tool is ridiculously expensive from the Shark web site,so I'll do without.All in all though,I love the job this vac does.

    I bought mine at sams mine did come with all the little tools for the car.  It's great on rugs and even better on hardwoods which is what ninety percent of our house is.  I love that it's easy to empty no bags to run out of. Not heavy at all my five yr old loves to use it.  I had been using a kirby this doesn't even compare my rugs look like new.  I love that it's very portable for a car or motor home and very good quality. I have had it a couple months no problems at all with it. Definitely great product for the money.

    I think this vacuum does a great job, it's easy to store in the closet and easy to get in and out, up and down stairs, etc. My old canister vacuum was so cumbersome that it wasn't probably used as often as it should have been. My cleaning lady also raves about it. She loves loves loves it and wants to get one for herself.

    I purchased my Shark Rocket from the military NEX. I LOVE IT. I have a one bedroom apartment with concrete floors and some rugs. I wanted something that would not shoot stuff across the bare floor when I was trying to vacuum it up. This device sucks everything up and nothing gets shot around the floor! The transition to bare floor to rugs is seamless, with just a quick push on your thumb, you change from bare floor mode to carpet mode, super easy! It is so lightweight and easy to maneuver. It is unfortunate that it can not sit upright, but that really is small in comparison to the many great benefits this vacuum has to offer. Great investment for sure!!!

    I love this vacuum! I always wanted a Dyson vacuum, but my mother-in-law told me she preferred her Shark to her Dyson, so I did some research. I'm really happy I went with this vacuum. It is very lightweight and powerful, has a long cord, has a lot of suction and makes cleaning super easy. I have a god that sheds a lot, and this vacuum takes care of it easily. I like the bag-free design, it is satisfying to see how much you just sucked up. The price was great too. This is the best vacuum I've ever owned, I recommend it to everyone.

    We purchased this vacuum because we needed something good and lightweight since we bring our own supplies. After trying several different vacuums this was PERFECT! We have had it for a month now and can’t imagine not having it. I am purchasing one now for my home to replace my brand new Kenmore because I just love how easy it is to use.  My only con is that I wish the button to disconnect the base (and switch to crack vac) could be pushed with your foot.

    Love!  My one and only ""complaint"" would be that since it is so top heavy you have to prop it up against something if you're going to walk away. Small price to pay for such a versatile machine. Just bought it and vacuumed where I just had with my old vacuum and picked up a half canister of junk. I don't have kids or pets or anything so I don't produce much dirt.  So it was a clear statement about how bad my old vacuum was, how great this one is or both.Overall weight it pretty light, had no issues maneuvering or lifting. Sleek low profile makes it easy to get under, over and between most of my furniture. Press a button and remove wand from base and before you know it you're re sucking dust bunnies from the ceiling, curtains and blinds. Snap on an attachment and clean couches and whatever else. This thing went everywhere. Very long cord so I can clean a whole story of the house without changing outlets. Highly recommend!

    We have a 3 level, 3,000 sq ft house with 60% wood floors. We plumbed it for a central vac as in previous home but given that hte cost for this Shark Rocket Upright was 5 times less than that of the hose, head, & accessories for the central vac decided to risk $200.  The gamble paid off. I agree with all the good stuff others have said. This thing sucks up dust, dog hair, food debris pine needles (including those embedded in carpet) wonderfully.  The flexibility and portability are real pluses.  Works great in car also.There are few negatives. It is noisy, is a bit top heavy which can get a bit tiring when doing the whole house at once, and the dust bin capacity is a bit low -- I usually have to empty it twice when doing the whole hose.  However, when compared to the deluxe Kenmore canister we have at a vacation home and the central vac in our previous home, this little sucker wins hands down.

    First word that comes to mind...WOW! I ordered this vacuum based on it's customer ratings and congratulations everyone, you got it right. Within 5 minutes of opening the box, I had it assembled and running. My first thought was how quiet it is for such a powerful motor. My wife had wet swiffered our tile floors (about 1000sq/ft) and vacuumed our three carpeted bedrooms (another 700sq/ft) just two days ago so I didn't expect to see too much dirt in the dust cup. Boy was I wrong! I ended up emptying it 4 times!! I had suspected our old machine wasn't very good, and this one confirmed my suspicions. It is by far the easiest to maneuver vacuum I've ever used and I would have finished the entire house in less than 30 minutes if I hadn't had to stop and remove so much hair (my wife loses enough hair to knit a sweater with every week) from the power brushhead and empty the dust bin frequently. Even this was a fairly easy process though, and I think there will be way less from now on.  Overall, while the top heavy design is a little different than a typical vacuum, the balanced maneuverability made the work so easy I won't mind it when my wife asks me to help with housecleaning in the future. My only complaint with the design is that it can't stand on it's own and must be propped against something if you need to move something out of the way. The included attachments are great also and should make detailing the car a breeze.  In a nutshell, you won't regret buying the Shark Rocket! It's not often a cleaning device impresses me enough to want to write a review, but this one does. It seems well made, it's lightweight despite it's impressive power, it comes with lots of accessories that should cover any dusting/cleaning task, and it has a great wall mount to store it out of the way. All for about half the price of a similar Dyson product.

    No joke, I found one of these by my student housing dumpster while I was in college and it turned out to be so good that we gave away our fancy, heavy duty vacuum cleaner in favor of the Rocket. The suction and maneuverability of this vacuum are excellent, but little features like how you can use it as a handheld + the hair cutting grooves make it a joy to use!One lesson I learned: if you start to lose suction, clean out the interior filter (it's the metal filter that looks like a reusable K-cup right in the middle of the dust reservoir). That little bit of maintenance returned the Rocket right to its former glory!

    Well iveonly had this one day and I've already vaccumed my house twice! i knew I needed a vaccum but I heard that Sharks customer service was horrendous. So when I asked the people at Best Buy about it they gave me THIER 4 year plan (25$ :) ) so now all I have to do is take it in there and exchange it in the store.The vaccum itself it QUITE top heavy and my wirst did start hurting after 20 minutes of vacuuming but that's fine by me! I had to get used to the darn thing get about moving on its own, I barley pushed it and off it went. And the turning is a tad odd at first (I have never had a vacuum with that kind of turning ability before.)

    I am no one of those vacuum-o-phile's... I detest it. So much that I would prefer to sweep my hard floors.Until I got this vacuum...Powerful, incredible suction, easy to empty and clean, ridiculously light - I can't go past how light it is. I've had handvac's heavier than this.I did my area rug once with it... It looked new. So easy to put together, disassemble.I'm actually looking forward to the next time I have to vacuum... This thing has converted me into one of those daily vacuumers...I never thought it would happen.One tiny complaint - the back cover for the exhaust filter - it comes off very easily - if your hand is in the wrong spot it may depress the button and the force of the exhaust will send it flying - very, very, very minor issue considering how well it works, lightness, power... etc.My mother just tried it out and she loves it compared to her D-brand -cough cough- vacuum. Notice D-brand doesn't even compare it in their ad... hmmm.Buy this vacuum!

    I was nervous about buying this after some of the complaints I read on line.  It is a fantastic vacuum.  Very easy to maneuver and very adaptable for all cleaning surfaces. I bought it for my new 5th wheel camper and we are thrilled with how it works.  I will be mounting it on the wall with the mounting bracket that came with it.  Just to see what would happen I used my $600 Dyson on my rug, then followed up with this $159 (got it on sale at Target) vac.  It filled the dirt cup!I can not speak to reliability nor longevity as I have only had this for a week, but I am impressed with the quality, especially for the price.

    We bought this vacuum from Bed, Bath, and Beyond.I love this vacuum for several reasons. I love how it's not over-complicated the tools and the mechanisms are easy to use. It's so light my wife loves packing it around the house, it is not longer a hassle to vacuum the house. The tools it includes can be very handy not only in cleaning your house but it opens up to just about anything. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the size of the canister. Which I know you compromise for when buying a smaller lighter vacuum.

    So, this is coming through my husband's name, but it's the wife writing this.First of all, I love this vacuum; I actually don't mind vacuuming with this vacuum, and (gasp!) sometimes even look forward to it.  No lie.  Our floor looks cleaner and even feels softer using this vacuum!  It's true.  It's easy to use and maneuver, and it picks up an insane amount of stuff off the floor, even the hard floor fills the dust can.  Also, even though the dust pan is smaller than a full upright, it's so easy to empty, that I don't mind at all!  In a nutshell, this is the best vacuum we have owned.  I love it so much, and it makes me happy.But what made me come write a review is Shark's excellent customer service.  About a month after I bought this vacuum, the cord got caught in something, and it got cut.  I cried, y'all!  I called Shark, even though it was technically my fault, so I didn't expect much.  I really just wanted to see if they had cords for purchase.  I wish they did.  Anyway, even though it wasn't their fault, but mine, they offered to pay for me to send it back to them and they would send me a new one at no cost.  I was blown away!  I sent it back in, and then I was surprised and impressed even more that not only did they send me a new vacuum, but they upgraded me to the Deluxepro for free!I'm amazed.  Best. Customer. Service. Ever.  Shark customer for life!

    I've had this vacuum for almost 3 years now and I have been extremely happy with it. It picks up dirt better then most vacuums I've had and is great for cleaning out cars. I am a Shark fan.

    The Rocket is the best invention since the printing press! Hard wood floors and a dog that sheds not dust bunnies but dust dinosaurs!  It is the absolute best household tool I have ever owned. I love it so much that  I plan on giving this wonderful super sucker as wedding gifts.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It sucks up ANYTHING! has a terrific long cord, is actually fun to use so I may use it more often than using a broom, it out performs every other vacuum I have ever owned in 35 years. I find that it cleans so well that my house seems to stay cleaner longer.I especially love that I can use it with the long tube for floors and ceiling cobwebs, and instantly take it apart to suck up the dead bugs in my window sill that has become the Bug Cemetery for the entire town. If you are even considering buying this... DO IT!  You will not be  sorry for a second. Now about my windows........

    I bought this almost a year ago and I love it! I previously had a Dyson Stick vaccum and wasn't impressed with it for the price. I got this and it is a great price and a great vacuum. It is light weight and comes with multiple attachments. It cleans up all the dog hair from our two dogs who shed a lot. Very pleased with this purchase.

    My lifestyle: Single; no pets; with hardwood, carpet, and tile floors. My home is 2,100 Sq Ft so not a small cleaning job. Currently own a Dyson DC33 and a small hand-held vacuum.As far as vacuum power the Dyson DC33 is doing fine after 3-years. However the weight, poor wand design (when cleaning high/low areas), and expense for extra cleaning tools started my search for a new machine. I looked at Dyson stick cleaners, Melia, etc. and it just gets more confusing and more expensive.My requirements were:1. Lightweight – less than 10 pounds2. Able to clean low, high, under furniture, and go from one floor style to another easily.3. Reasonable cost at under $200Based on reviews and feedback posted I decided to try the Shark Rocket Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner - Model # HV301. I was able to purchase this one for $152 from Lowes and also considered the return policy that if I did not like it after 30-days I could return it without any issues.In a nutshell…I plan on keeping the Shark Rocket Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner - Model # HV301 unless something happens before the 30-days are up.Pro:1. This little machine is POWERFUL. Although I do not have any suction measuring tools, seems as powerful as my Dyson D33 and picked up anything that was on the rug, floor, or tile.2. Has extensive tools for all floor types, and what is great is I can use the whole extension or take the extension out for cleaning furniture, carpeted stairs (with the power head/brush), and just areas you cannot get to easily. The swivel steering feature works as advertised and makes cleaning much easier.3. I was skeptical at first about the Dust-Away HW Floor attachment. Basically vacuums and the micro-fiber cloth dusts too. I have to say…worked great. I tried with just vacuuming (no cloth) and then the same area with the cloth and the cloth picked up dirt/dust that the vacuum did not get by itself.4. Only weighs 8 pounds and the attachments are in a bag versus onboard. Personally, I like this set-up better.5. I can vacuum UNDER my bed, couch, behind the couch, etc. without having to change anything on the vacuum. For me this is an awesome feature and you can get down to 4” so most furniture would not have to be moved.6. I can now get rid of the small cordless vacuum…one less machine to maintain or replace (which is what was needed).Con:1. Cleaning Path Width (Inches) of 8.75 so if you have huge area to vacuum then you will have to work harder2. No Carpet Height Adjustment – but for me the two speeds/settings worked fine3. The bagless cup will hold a good amount of dirt/dust BUT if you have pets, kids, etc. you will probably have to empty it frequently.4. To empty the cup you have to take the head/power unit to the trash can, the cup does not detach from the head/power unit.5. If you plan on using this for your vehicle too, not the best option/choice, you can purchase separately the Car Detail Kit accessory though.Hopes this helps anyone trying to decide on this vacuum.

    I love this little sweeper!  It is so powerful for such a little machine.  I was amazed that the ads were true...after vacuuming with my old vacuum and then re-vacuuming with the Shark Rocket, I couldn't believe all the pet hair and dirt the old vacuum had left! We have rugs on concrete floor in most of our house, and the Shark Rocket is great on both surfaces.  I am thinking of buying one for my son.

    I bought this vacuum last night and just used it for the first time.  I am very impressed!!! Over the past year I would say I purchased 3 vacuums because they keep going out or working improperly.  I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and this vacuum is working just fine for me. I was hesitant at first because of the price, however I eventually talked myself into getting it.  Glad I made that choice, so far so good :)

    God this really works like a shark, no wonder they call it shark. This little thing is so light and so easy to vacuume with and goes under almost everything. I have a pom pom who sheds alot, I mean alot, I used to hate vacuuming until I bought Mr. Shark. I vacuum almost every day and never disappointed, when I clean I cant believe how much dust and dog hair it has socked. Its very powerfull and if you have pet I highly recommend this product. I dont think I would buy another product after using this. I am in love with my shark.

    My old vacum must've been the crappiest ever, because the amount of dirt that this vacum sucked out of my carpet, was out of this world. So glad I made this purchase,  because now I can rest assured that my vacum is doing it's job right. Also it was super easy to clean out the hair from the brush, so that was a major plus! Buy it, it will change your life!

    My main priority in selecting a new vacuum cleaner as a woman with back issues was a lightweight but effective upright that I could easily carry up stairs and around the house. This vacuum is just that! I find myself looking for opportunities to do a chore I used to dread because of back pain. The extended cord allows me to cover a bigger area without bending over to remove the cord, again preventing strain. The dust bin must be emptied often, but, as other reviewers have stated, that just lets me know the vacuum is doing its job. I love that it is compact enough that I can keep it mounted on its bracket rather than cluttering a closet. If you are looking for the most powerful vacuum on the market, you might want to look elsewhere; however, if ease of use and efficiency are important to you, I highly recommend!

    I had seen the infomercial and really wanted to try it. I finally got one and i love it! I have a 4 bedrm. 2 story colonial with full finished basement and it works great on all my carpeting and tile floors. On the tile floors the dirt or cinders from the garage do not shoot back. It picks up everything. I esp love the brush and the size of the head the actually deep cleans the steps. For the first time, they look so much cleaner than just an attachment that only lifts surface lint. Its is lightweight for my tendonitis arm. I compared it to the Dyson and that Dyson is over priced and over engineered for a household vac. The Shark has a lot of great features and good value for the money. Yes i would recommend this vac.

    We have had a few dysons over the years and I have to say that this shark comes very close in the amount of suction and dirt pick up. It is SUPER lightweight and very easy to push and pull. The brush comes off at the push of a button so you can use the hose tip for small corners.

I am pleasantly surprised with the performance of this lightweight. Im glad I bought it. Very easy to use and great suction.It goes from carpet to bare floor with a flick of your thumb on the button positioned convienently on the handle without missing a stroke. No filter to buy ,easy to empty without touching the dirt. Order ,you wont be sorry. I do not work for the Shark corp. LOL

    Excellent vacuum - no reservations. I actually got it at Target four months ago. Very easy to empty dirt cup. Cord length is just right for me - small home. Beater bar for door mats only since I have wood floors, but it is very powerful. Bought additional dust away pads through Amazon - terrific addition gets up what a vacuum always misses. No need for a swiffer. Tipping over isn't an issue - I had expensive large vacuums that did that. Easy to store. Wish I had purchased one long ago.

    This vacuum is worth every penny!  With two dogs and one cat at home, I need a vacuum that can suction all that pet hair... and then some!  This vacuum does just that, and also comes with an additional ""pet fur"" head that is very helpful to use on the bed, the couch and all the pillows.  I also enjoy the lightweight stature of this vacuum, as it allows me to reach the dust bunnies that like to collect on the ceiling fan and in the corners of the ceiling itself.  This is my first time writing a review for a product; after using this vacuum I just had to spread the word!

    I gave away my 2-month Shark whatever-it-was because it was so heavy and impossible for me, a short, little-old-lady, to maneuver.  This lightweight Rocket is so much easier to user and works just as well as the monster contraption I got rid of.

    We bought the Rocket after our cordless Dyson wouldn't hold a charge, after only six weeks.  The Rocket is fantastic.  It is lightweight, maneuverable, and the power head does an awesome job on carpet.  (As opposed to the wind-powered head on the Dyson, which was a complete joke....)  With the microfiber cover, the hard floor head picks up everything, even scraps of dogfood (which the Dyson wouldn't.)  Don't waste your money on any other vac.  This is it!!

    I just moved into a small apartment from a big house and needed a small vacuum I could easily fit in a closet. Let me tell you that I've had Dyson's for the last 10 years, but didn't have the budget this month to invest $500 on a vacuum. I bought this little gem and I'm so happy I did. It absolutely worked just as well as my Dyson did with the added benefit that it's self-propelled. I will say that the footprint is a little smaller, so if you had a big house, it might take a little longer to clean, but the suction is really amazing and it picked up way more dirt than I ever thought I had. Great job Shark! This is a great brand!

    I have to be honest, I'm not easily impressed, and Shark had did it for me! I broke my rocket accidentally after being a little too rough with the unit. I contacted shark, and found out I had a 5 year warranty on the vacuum. They sent me a shipping label, and about less than a week after, I received a replacement unit with all the extra attachments. I now have 2 sets of Shark Rocket accessories and a new vacuum unit!Thanks Shark! keep up the good work!

    I got this for my mom as her old vacuum did not seem to be picking much up.  We were both amazed at how much the Shark picked up, and not just the first time we vacuumed, but every time we vacuumed.  It is also incredibly light weight- great for her and the main reason I want one.  I also really like the versatility of this vacuum in that it is almost like a regular vac, a stick vac, and a ""dust buster"" all in one.

My old vacuum cleaner was heavy and clumsy AND did not have a good suction.  The first time my husband used the Shark Rocket he had to empty the canister 3 times. He could not believe how much dust was in two area rugs. My old cleaner obviously was not doing the job.  I don’t understand some of the bad reviews because this vacuum cleaner is FANTASTIC.

    I never write reviews but I had to for the shark rocket! I absolutely love it! I am a housekeeper and all I ever used was a rainbow vacuum because nothing ever compared to the quality of cleaning from the rainbow vacuum. Then  had neck surgery and needed something lighter. I ordered the shark rocket after watching every infomercial under the sun. I absolutely am obsessed with it. I can do everything with it and it is so easy to clean the filters.  It slides right under furniture and the suction is more powerful than my rainbow vacuum. CUSTOMER SERVICE was amazing!!!! My motor burned out because I used it so often and because of my  5 year warranty that came with it, they replaced the floor attachment for free!  I don't think I have ever been so completely satisfied with a vacuum on all checkpoints.  Got it right with this one! My neck is now completely healed and I still favor my shark and don't even use my rainbow vacuum anymore.

    Okay, I'm a vacuum fanatic. I have had the likes of Tristar, Hoover, Dyson, Electrolux, roomba, you name it.  This Rocket by far, is the best for its size and weight.  Before this vacuum my Tri-star canister  was the best of the lot but it is at least 15 years old and heavy.  it was also 1200 bucks. Today its duck taped together and needs a lot of work after all these years of use. Hence the Rocket purchase. I can't say enough good things about this vacuum and in my opinion it DOES clean better than a Dyson upright which I also have.I haven't got to the attachments yet but for carpet, furniture, and bare floors it works great.

    Like everyone else, I saw the infomercial and thought yea right.  So.... whenever I want to get something, I come here to read the reviews.  I read them and went to Wallyworld and got one yesterday. It's easy to put together and it's called ROCKET for a reason.  It has great suction and boy does it go.  It has a long cord for a reason too.  When you vacuum, you will have to empty out the small container which means the top part including the cord goes with you to the trash. (or keep a small trashcan with you and you won't have to go far )  I have a shedding dog and cat and this vac is fantastic.  I have noodle arms but it didn't hurt my arms when I was done, and maybe I'll build them up now. lol  It has an attachment you can hang this too on the wall, or the top part comes off and attaches to the bottom for storage.  It cleaned my carpet, tiled and hardwood floors.  I haven't used the other attachments but they aren't as important to me as the vacuuming itself.  Glad I got it.

    I absolutely LOVE it.  So easy to get under and around furniture. Good suction.  Works GREAT on stairways. Lots of attachments.  No need for another vacuum.  You have to empty the dirt more often, but it's very easy. Nice storage bag for all the attachments.

    This is the best vacuum cleaner I have ever had.  My last one was a Shark Navigator and the HV302 Rocket cleans faster, better and with less effort then the Navigator.  Changing attachments is easier also.  You won't go wrong buying one of these!

    Exactly what I was looking for!  It has two different brush speeds depending on what kind of floor you are vacuuming:  in the kitchen, I can use the brush on the lower speed to vacuum the linoleum.  Then I can switch to the higher speed to vacuum the rugs, and it works extremely well!  It maneuvers quite easily underneath the kitchen table and around the chairs, and is so lightweight that I can carry it all around the house with me to clean every room.  I used it on the hardwood floors in the rest of the house, and the attachment with the dusting pad picked up so much dirt and dust - I was amazed.  Moving the vacuum from room to room is also easier because the cord is so long. I have bad back, so having to drag out my old Kenmore vacuum every day was quite a struggle; but this vacuum is so small that I can just literally leave it standing upright in the kitchen leaning against the wall.  The only drawback is that it doesn't stand on its own, you have to lean it against something or hang it up on the provided hook.  The attachments are nice, and I am planning to purchase the additional ones online.

    I used one of these at a rental house on our last vacation and it worked so well I bought one myself thinking it might be a good ""in between "" vac, more than the battery powered hand vac and not as bulky as the ""real"" vac in the closet. Boy was I wrong! After I unpacked it and checked all the pieces (lots of extras) I put it together and gave it a trial run in my apparently clean office rug. I messed around with it for no more than a minute or a minute and a half before emptying the dirt compartment. It was full! A handful of dirt and dust that it beat out of my clean rug and a double handful of cat hair that had been invisible to me. I'm not obsessive about cleaning but I like to think I keep the place neat and the cleaning lady comes once a week to give it a good going over so these results truely amazed me. The downside is that it works so well that it fills the smallish dirt compartment pretty fast. The upside is that it works so well that it fills the smallish dirt compartment pretty fast.

    I bought this to replace the built-in central vacuum in my RV, which didn't have spinning brushes and did not get the carpet clean at all.I am always hesitant to purchase jaything that takes up very much space since I live in the RV full time.This vacuum is compact and totally worth the space it does take up. The carpets literally look new again. I also appreciate that all the attachments come in a storage bag to keep them all together and organized.This vacuum is very versatile. At first I was overwhelmed with all the different pieces that can be taken apart but now appreciate that this makes it almost like two different tools: a full-size vacuum and a handheld like a dustbuster.It's a little annoying to clean the brushroll but I've never owned a vacuum for which this wasn't the case.

    Day one, I am in love with this Shark Rocket vacuum. My expectations were pretty low after reading some of the reviews, plus I’m a vacuum snob, but I bought this mainly in hopes that I could finally get my carpeted stairs clean. I actually still haven’t tried to clean the stairs properly yet, but I was totally surprised by how well it works on carpet and tile.The image shows how it picks up lots of super fine dust that my stand-up Hoover missed. It picked all of that up in just a small area of “clean” carpet. That Hoover is already out in the garage, waiting to be dumped or sold! After vacuuming several rooms with this Shark Rocket, the white filter was almost completely grey with fine dust already. I definitely don’t mind replacing filters often if it’s keeping that out of my house and sinuses! By the way... my carpets haven’t been this fluffy in years! I couldn’t be happier.The suction is very strong (YAY!!) so I would be careful with area rugs and delicate surfaces.It out-performs every other vacuum I’ve ever used (including Dyson, Hoover, Bissell, and more, including two brands of robot vacuums) when it comes to tile floors. Every other vacuum would shoot/spray out debris back towards my feet as I was vacuuming. So frustrating. This Shark Rocket doesn’t do that! It picks up everything without spraying junk all over the place. The only things it couldn’t pick up were larger feathers dropped by our medium-sized parrot.Of course it is quite top heavy... and my arms got a good work out while using it since you basically have to carry the weight of it the entire time you’re using it. You do need a bit of hand strength since the heavy part you’re holding on to is also vibrating a bit. It is easy to detach the heavy motor/canister when you need to take a break or set it down without it falling over.Setting up the vacuum was as easy as clicking the motor to the pole and the pole to the vacuum head. It was ready to use in seconds after unboxing it.One thing I wish they would’ve done is make the power cord detachable. The cord is pretty heavy, and it isn’t convenient having to carry it around and hold it out of the way when you need to empty the canister.Also, the swiveling vacuum head kinda has a mind of its own, and always seems to swivel directly into furniture, walls and corners that I’m trying to vacuum around. 🤷🏻‍♀️It does shoot hot air straight back towards you as you’re using it... it would have been a plus if they could’ve made it shoot the air out to the side instead.I had to untangle a few hairs and fabric threads from the rolling brush, but it wasn’t an issue. Keeping up with that regularly so it doesn’t get unmanageable would be a good idea.Due to the weight of it that you have to support, I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone with strength or mobility issues. For me, it is one of the best purchases I’ve made in years, and I actually look forward to cleaning my floors again. I will update this once I start using the attachments/if my opinion changes.

    This is a report on the function and utility of the Shark Ultralite corded vac. I can't comment on its durablility since I have only used it for one day. The unit is well packaged and very simple to assemble. I used it to vacuum both high and low piled carpets and was amazed at the amount of dirt in the cup. It is light, easy to push and maneuver with the exception of very narrow places which required removing the power brush and using a small brush on the end of the wand. Next I vacuumed a large amount of ceramic tile that didn't appear to have much dirt on it and again was surprised at how much dirt was in the cup. The dust container is a little small but I don't know how it could be larger on such a compact and easy to use machine.I hope my experience continues as I am a little worried about a number of reviewers saying that the connecting hose broke early on. So far I am delighted and keeping my fingers crossed.

    This thing is awesome. I was looking for a hand vac with a LONG wand, so I could walk around with it comfortably while vacuuming along the edges of hard floors. (We have pets, and it seems like the middle of those hard floors don't get particularly dusty but a ton of stuff accumulates in the corners and along the edges.) It works great for this, but the base works great too, so it's all I need for whole rooms, for both carpet and hard floors.There are other great features of this vac, too. I like the extra-long cord, and can go pretty much as far as I need to with this it. (I would like to ask--why doesn't anyone make a retractable cord like those retractable dog leashes? It would be so much easier than handling the cord while it's flopping on the ground.) Also the dust-dumping procedure is simple and REALLY WORKS--when you hold the cup over the trash and open the bottom, the dirt actually falls out! (I have had other vacs where his doesn't work at all; stuff gets all tangled up in the cup and you end up having to sort of pry it out, which makes a dusty, sneezy mess.) The dirt-dump has worked well with pet fur, dust, firewood scraps, sandy grit, and every other thing I've vacuumed up these last six months.  The filters are easy to remove, clean, and re-insert (also unlike other vacs for which I have to take out the manual and puzzle over it every few months).This vacuum is replacing a much larger, more expensive Dyson-wannabe that I absolutely hated. It was heavy, clumsy, got stalled by carpet threads and fur really easily, and was impossible to clean. I despise the Dysons too--too expensive while also feeling cheap and plastic, and not very effective. Yeah, I have strong opinions about vacuum cleaners. (I still miss the $50 wedding gift upright Hoover we used for 20 years until it just smelled too much like cat litter.) But THIS one, this Shark, is right on the money. At first I was shocked by the high price for what seemed like just a hand vac, but it's way more than that.I have one small complaint. The handle is comfortable to hold, but because you tend to pivot and move it around a lot while vacuuming, on me it rubs a blister at the knuckle on my thumb. Not a big deal, and I'm learning to adapt my hold on it so this won't happen. Not sure exactly how the handle would need to be redesigned to fix this, but I think it could be done. Otherwise (and maybe besides adding that retractible cord!) don't change a thing! This vac is great!

    I remember when Shark was starting out and nobody knew who they were.  I don't think too many people bought their products at first. Fast forward to today and now they are in competition with Dyson . The quality is just as good or maybe even better than Dyson but at a fraction of  the price. My previous vacuum is a Dyson but wanted something lighter . my home is more wooden floor than carpet. So this is my first Shark and let me tell you...It's a very good quality vacuum . Built solid and the suction is very strong. The rotating head has a low speed for wooden floors and high speed for carpet. And it is powerful. It actually pulls your arm forward at the carpet setting. I chose the corded version because I consider battery powered items throw away items. The battery will eventually run out and the cost of the battery is almost as expensive as the whole tool so you throw away the old one and buy a new one. With the corded version the price is much cheaper plus I don't have to worry about the battery giving out. I've had my Dyson for about 15 yrs and still works as if it was brand new, and I expect this Shark to last just as long or even longer. I am truly happy with this Shark vacuum and do HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

    Wow, after 35-some years looking for a lightweight yet strong, easy-to-use vacuum, I've found it! This is really awesome. It's VERY easy to use, including easy access and cleaning of filter (had NO idea where it was on my last vacuum), easy to dump out the debris collector, easy to transition from handheld to full and interchange the various attachments, and super easy to carry up the stairs (it's VERY light). I'm hesitant to use this on my hardwood floors because on 'low' the beater bar thing still spins, albeit slower and there is one attachment that seems it would be for hardwood floors perhaps but the suction did not seem that strong. So, I'm very happy to use this on my new carpeting including on the stairs and I use a microfiber broom on the hardwood floors.

    I thought I kept a clean house until this arrived and I used it the next morning. I emptied the dust canister so many times I think I need either therapy or asthma treatments just thinking about all the guck that has been living in my (regularly vacuumed) carpets. So glad I didn’t spend a fortune on a Dyson. From the time I opened the box to when I was vacuuming: 3 minutes. Light and easy to use. Extra long power cord means I don’t constantly have to unplug and replug in every corner of each room. Super easy to push the button and empty the horrifyingly full dust canister. I’ve used the pet attachment already to vacuum upholstered furniture and it works well. Didn’t need to switch the floor attachment between carpet and tile, as just flicking the switch between “hard floor” and “plush carpet” was more than sufficient. Very happy.

    This machine is a refurbished vacuum.  I have watched infomercials for over two years on the Shark vacuums.  I was going to buy the Rotator vacuum but then saw this light weight canister model that I could handle easier than the full-sized model.  I am physically challenged with balance and stability when standing.  This model came in 3 pieces - motorized sweeper head, vacuum extension and canister/motor assembly.  After unpacking all 3 pieces I had it assembled in about 5 minutes.  The suction on this model is just as powerful as the full-sized Shark Rotator.Being modular in construction, I can connect the canister/motor assembly directly to the sweeper head and vacuum my carpets from a seated position which works well for me.  I would highly recommend this vacuum to people who cannot stand up to vacuum normally or easily.  Since this is a refurbished vacuum, I paid significantly less than what a new vacuum would cost.  The plus in buying refurbished is that the unit has been completely restored to like-new condition at a fraction of the cost.  I buy most items refurbished and have had no problems.  It helps stretch the budget, too!

    This vacuum is awesome, has a long cord which is always great! It has very nice sucking power and it has many different attachments for everything imaginable, including a car detailing kit!?!?!  But one of my favorite things is even if you don’t change the attachments, you can take the topOff and just have a little handheld or you can take the bottom head part off and have a nice stick/pole. The onlyNegatives about this vacuum is that it falls over, so you have to screw the holder into the wall and hang it, you can notLean it against the wall, it will not work, will definitely fall! And you have toEmpty the thing more often because it’s a small compartment, to make its slimmer and lighter etc....  but even with those negatives it’s still I think one of my favorites and best vacuums I’ve used and as a cleaner I’ve tried many!

    This works great! I use it on my tile flooring and low-pile carpet, and it picks up everything, including hair from my two shedding cats. It works equally as well as (if not better than) much larger vacuums designed for strong suction and pet hair which I have used in the past on the same rug.I'm very impressed with it. I will try to remember to update in a couple years (or sooner if it breaks) to let you know how it continues to work.Aside from suction, I'm also impressed with the number of detail wands and brushes it comes with. The brush is a good choice for upholstery. These tiny pieces come with a large bag to hold them all in - very grateful for that. The vacuum itself is also well-designed and detaches from a couple points. I like that the heavy top (motor part) detaches and hangs on a hook lower down on the handle so that it can stand by itself during storage.This was thoughtfully designed.

    I have lower back issues and vacuuming is one of those chores that would cause considerable discomfort. In the past I've always adopted ""non-shedding"" dogs. I recently adopted a dog that not only sheds, she also loves to roll around in the dirt. It was causing a great deal of difficulty keeping my house clean until I purchased the Ultra-Light upright. It's light enough that my back is not affected. It does a great job with the dirt and dog fur and I've even used the hand held to vacuum my dog on occasion (she was perfectly ok with me doing it).

    This vacuum is awesome! I have four cats and need a reliable and strong vacuum in order to keep up with all the hair around the house. I had a different brand of vacuum before and even though it worked great on my two area rugs, the incredible loud noise freaked my cats out so that they were terrified of the vacuum and I had to put them outside every time I wanted to vacuum.The Shark Rocket is half as loud as my old vacuum and does the job just as well. I can actually clean the house while the cats are inside the house putting less stress on them. I love the shark because it is really light, has a very long cord, and comes with several useful attachments. The filters are easy to reach and easy to clean. Lastly, the dirt container is very easy to empty, yet it could be a little bigger. Overall I love the vacuum and so far it has been working great.

    I bought one for my daughter I finally tried it. I was sold, every home should have one! I have a bad back and couldn't vacuum anymore at all!! Well I can now, this Shark is light, has BETTER suction than my big vacuum, which I never thought possible. I'm so thrilled with it! I only have 2 down sides.  1. It's reservoir for holding the dirt is very small, you have to empty it often but the cord is long enough to reach a far away trash can or take a bag with you?  2. It doesn't stand up by itself you must prop against a wall or lean on something. It does come with a hanger for attaching to wall for storage. I would still buy with these 2 minor setbacks! It's well worth the money.

    We live at the beach -- and this vacuum really pulls up the sand.  The canister is small and needs to be emptied each time -- but that just shows how well it works.  It's a little strange to ""steer"" but you get used to it.  It's like a canister vacuum in that you can get into small places and under beds, but it is an up-right, so it doesn't take up a lot of space in your closet.  Bought for our beach house, but seriously considering purchasing another one for our summer home.  Really love it.

    I own a Dyson. I bought the Shark primarily for hardwood floors and throw rugs on my first floor. I bought it because several people who reviewed said it worked as well as their Dyson. I have to agree. I wanted a cordless vacuum but needed more cleaning time than the 15 or 20 minutes most cordless vacuums provide. This vacuum delivers. It is quiet, lightweight, easy to use, came with great attachments and, quite frankly, for less than $200 it is an exceptional value.

    From the moment I bought this, I had buyer’s remorse.  I really wanted a cordless stick for the vinyl plank flooring downstairs, but didn’t want the headache of changing a battery mid-clean. so much for that fear!  The cord truly isn’t a bother and the suction doesn’t vary no matter how long I clean.  Great buy, too!

    Okay, so I'm a total clean freak - almost verging on OCD - and I vacuum w/ my Eureka Boss upright A LOT.  I thought it was the bomb w/ all the attachments and power, but it was really heavy to push around, and getting the stairs - even with the attachments - was getting more and more tedious.  Then I tried this Shark last night and WOW!!  I could not BELIEVE the dirt, dust, and dog hair that this picked up!  Just doing my stairs alone filled up the dust cup, but it was SO fast and easy!  Putting it together was a snap, it's lightweight, and it comes w/ all the attachments you'll need to get your house clean from (literally) top to bottom!  I'm very happy w/ this purchase and you can't beat the price Amazon offered at the time I bought it ($111).  Highly recommend!

    After searching for the perfect vacuum I think I have finally found it! I recently moved from a 2-story townhome (944 sq ft) to a larger tri-level house (2036 sq ft). I found that sweeping and vacuuming the tile and carpet in this house was taking me too long and wanted something that would simplify my life since I am the one doing the majority of the cleaning at home. This machine meets my needs and I no longer have to sweep the ceramic tile (or use a separate vacuum for hard floors) and then switch to a big heavy vacuum for the carpets. I own a dyson upright and I think the suction on this vacuum is just as good, if not better. I like the fact that I don't have to buy filters for this vacuum. I have already cleaned the filters once and they came completely clean with just rinsing in warm water. This unit has 2 speeds, one for solid floors, and a stronger speed for deep cleaning carpets. I have one cat and it amazes me that even if I vacuum every single day this vacuum is pulling up a lot of dirt and hair. I like the extra long cord, so I don't have to unplug the machine for every room. I believe this product is a great value compared to the competition and I am very satisfied with my purchase.

    Living in a studio I needed something compact (and really wanted something with a cord long enough to reach the whole place). This vacuum has been great so far. Snaps together easily, comes apart with the few buttons. Great suction. A ton of tools including a great little car kit. It’s dramatically more powerful than my previous vacuum and is the simplest to clean of all the vacuums I’ve ever owned! It gets into right spaces and under the bed easily.

    This is awesome.  Easy to use, cord is nice and long and it suck great.  Have five dogs in house currently, six if you count the hair on the floor everyday.  Takes just about 15 minutes to get, use, empty a lot and store.  Live in New Mexico the land of dust lots and lots of dust.  This unit cleans that up better than my big shop vac I use to use and so much easier to use.  Get it here on Amazon it is the cheapest price I have seen for unit.  Beats the Dyson hands down especially considering Dyson's battery only last 8 to 10 minutes which isn't long enough to do the job complete. Only caution the cup that catches the dirt is small so make sure to empty often which is no big deal.  Just hold unit over trash can and push the button.  Most stuff falls right out. Sometimes you need to use a small clean dry paint brush to remove fine dust.  Just love this tool. I could go on and on about all the easy cleaning you can with this unit.

    This is such a welcome relief from a similarly designed Dyson I’ve been using for five years. First that was a cordless and charging was a pain and it always stopped vacuuming before I wanted to. The cord is so long, I can do my 1000 foot apartment without stopping to unplug. Second the build is solid and the way the little doors and parts fit together is solid. Dyson felt chintzy. The design is simple. Easy to find and clear any clogs (I tend to vacuum up anything that doesn’t get me first). Good large capacity dust thingy. Comes with lots of little attachments and doo dads. Sound is less shrill and less annoying then Dyson, and overall just easier to handle. It sort of self propels, so pushing is easy. If you ever tried to lean the dyson against something for even a second, you know it always crashed to the ground, and the dust compartment clattered open and the dirt was everywhere. This has a lot more stand on its own two feet ability, so it doesn’t keep falling down. Dyson has great customer service, but I did get tired of calling them—this just feels so much more intuitive.

    Just received my new Shark.  I haven't had my own vacuum cleaner in nearly a decade, a chronic borrower.  I've witnessed the rise of Dyson and have always been a fan of their great designs and excellent products.  Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want a Dyson.  But Dyson's are so expensive.  I started researching other options and the Shark came up on a lot of 'best of' lists.  Upon receiving the vacuum I immediately opened the box and was quite surprised by all of the attachments, including, micro-attachments, something I've never seen before.  The vacuum cleaner is pretty intuitive, as far as assembly, and it simply works great.  It's lightweight and felt quick to use.  The cleaning head is small enough to fit around furniture legs and underneath tight spaces.  Just a great product.

    After recently installing new hard floors throughout most of our home, I was searching for a lightweight vacuum that would clean both the hard floors and area rugs.  I never thought that I would ever say that I now enjoying vacuuming, but this Shark Rocket Ultra-Light stick vac has been a real changer.  It has great suction and the swivel head makes it so easy to go under furniture, around and through dining table/chair legs and along baseboards.  This is the first vac that gets squarely into the corners under the kitchen cabinets.  The vac is super simple to assemble is less than a minute, to empty the dirt cup, put on attachments to sweep air duct grilles, refrigerator grilles, ceiling corners or wherever.  It is also so lightweight that it is no big deal to carry up and down stairs for multi-level cleaning.  In fact, our basement is finished and has carpeted floors, and this little gem thoroughly sweeps the carpet.  I love this vac so much that I just gave one to my daughter as a birthday gift.  Be sure to order some extra filters to have on hand when you clean the one that comes with the unit.  That way, you'll be able to vac when you need to without having to wait for the filter to dry.  The only cons for this unit is that with the location of the unit's cord, you have to drag that around with you to empty the dirt cup and that it is top heavy and doesn't stand on it's own.  However, those are negligible given the suction, maneuverability and lightweight design.  Highly, highly recommend!

    Few things I love about this vacuum.Incredibly lightweight—-I cant stress how perfect it is for 2story homes.Works extremely well on hardwood floors!!! I’ve never had a vacuum that picks up as well as this one does on hardwood floorsThe options and attachments on this vacuum are perfect.  I thought it would be difficult and cumbersome (like past vacuums) to switch/add on parts but it really isn’t.  It’s even EASY to drag to the car to use!The suction is insane for how small the device is!Things that could be improved:Size of the dust container.  Seems to fill up quickly but do I really want it much bigger?  Not really so EHHIt doesn’t stand when the top is on.  BUT it attaches so easily to the front in a neat discrete way so, I really don’t care.

    We gave up on our ancient canister vacuum that bears a name that's top rated by Consumer Report.  Because new models by that maker were not suited to our fixed income, we bought this less expensive vacuum that also got a good rating.  So far, it has shown itself ready to tackle hardwood floors, area rugs of different thicknesses and plenty of longer dog hair.  We like that the top detaches for hand vacuuming and that a variety of tools help us reach under the fridge and above our heads.  We were used to a corded vac so are okay with this corded model.  The cord really is long enough to leave plugged if you move to another room.  I miss the auto cord wrap of other vacuums and would like to empty the dirt collector less often, but we are super happy with this buy.  If this Rocket isn't durable, will be back to add a note here.

    I have had this vacuum for 5 days and I am IN LOVE. I have a giant, lovable mastiff whose hair sheds like you wouldn’t believe... not only am I constantly covered in hair but I have tumbleweeds of dog hair floating about my hardwoods on any given day. My dark blue carpet gets matted with hair as soon as I vacuum it up! I have a Roomba and it just doesn’t do what I need. That said, this vacuum has been a lifesaver (and it was super affordable.) It’s so versatile with all the extensions... I actually vacuumed my floorboards and blinds!... but more importantly, it does wonders with dog hair. The hardwood gets clean instantly, and once it’s switched into carpet mode, it sucks up the dog hair in 1/4 of the time my old vacuum did without leaving a single hair behind. The suction is so impressive, I was physically  pulled forward once I switched into carpet mode! Other reviewers complained about the cord length - personally, I love it. There’s less unplugging/resetting and you can stay in your groove and cover 2 rooms at once. My ONLY gripe is the ‘max fill’ line on the bagless canister is pretty small. I have to empty it quite a bit each vacuum (3-4 times) and it doesn’t separate from the vacuum itself so you have to unplug everything completely and carry the whole thing to a trash bin to empty. That said, that small inconvenience is completely offset but everything fantastic about this powerful little machine. I could not recommend this enough, especially for those with pets who are looking for a sleek and compact option!

    Love this little vacuum so far. I received it about a month ago and its everything I wanted. I didnt want a cordless because I didn't want to run out of battery mid room. It has great suction power, and I love that it has a floor and carpet option since my home is all floor but if I ever decide to get an area rug i could still use the same vacuum. I do clean it every time i use it to avoid clogging with hair. I will say it doesnt pick up dog kibbles so not for big trash but it's great for pet hair, dirt, and dust (everyday trash) on floors.Can't say much on how long it lasts though

We recently had LVP floring put in and I was sick of having dust kicked up by the broom and noticed this bad boy on Amazon. And it picked up everything!!!!! I absolutely love it! NO REGRETS!!!!In the picture I vacuumed up a bunch of pieces to a carpet I was cutting and the video speaks for itself.

    I was a little concerned when I received this vacuum because it is so lightweight but the suction alone makes this vacuum awesome! I have two cats and a dog and this vacuum pulls up hair that I absolutely did not see! It is so versatile as well making it easy and actually enjoyable to clean walls, baseboards, behind beds, between fridge and wall in kitchen. The attachments are so useful as well as the car detailing kit. Oh! and the ability to remove the roller brush to clean it if needed is a great feature.  I am happy with this purchase!

    Happy with my new Shark.  I do have a Dyson upright, but it is hard to vacuum my furniture with.  It is very easy with the Shark.  My husband even vacuumed dust off the wall, had to get a picture of that.UPDATE: Had it about 4 months now and it loses suction.  I wash the filters, clean the roller, wiped the inside of the bin.  It is getting to be too much maintenance.  I may have to use my Dyson to clean my Shark.  If this continues even though I have done everything I will try to return it.  Too bad too.  My kids both have Dyson stick vacs, should have listened to them.******UPDATE AGAIN:  PROBLEM ALL MY FAULT.  I had picked up a bottle cap that got stuck in the hose entry to the dust cup and I never saw it.  My husband fixed it up  bu removing the clog.  No wonder my wand got full.

    how did i live without this? and to think i was a canister fanatic! this is such a breeze to take out, moves really fast, and sucks like crazy. And i love that you can see how much dirt you get out, it really feels you are doing something...the only small thing is that when you take the long hose off and just use the floor piece, eg to clean stairs, the joint moves around and it is a little difficult to maneuver. it would be nice if you could lock it in position for some jobs. but not a big deal.cord is extra long which means you can do almost a whole floor without changing.and it's very light. as i said, a pleasure to vacuum. and i would never dream that!

    Basically this is a big handvac so you're not going to get the power of a full size vacuum with a bigger motor.  If you're looking for a cleaner that can get into tight spots or under low beds than this is a good vacuum.  It seems to be plenty powerful but if you're used to shark vacs you know you have to empty them often.  Possibly multiple times during the same cleaning session.  You also have to clean the filter often.  I would call this a hand vac that can also do carpets well enough.  But if you have a huge amount of carpet in a big house than the navigator is a better choice (which I also have).  I'm using this vac to get behind and under furniture without moving it.  As long as it keeps running I'll be extremely happy.

    Sweeping is my most dreaded task. We moved into a much larger apartment that has tiled floors throughout. I made my most adult purchase yet of an 8×10 beautiful red area rug. And so I bought this good boy. I use it on our marble floors (dude, I don't think our slumlord knows that they're real marble) and it doesnt damage it and on the wooden floors, damage free. That suction really packs a punch, too. We live with the world's two best kitties and my partner, the barn animal as I like to call him (the guy is just like Pig Pen from the Peanuts) has long thick curly hair that leaves a trail behind him like Hansel's and Gretel's crumbs. Those black-Irish tumbleweeds don't stand a chance when I come 'round with the Stick Wick as he calls it.My only thing is that I wish that there was an upholstery attachment with a rotating brush. But whatever. I'm not complaining.

    I have a Dyson Ball Vac which I like very much but sometimes it is a bit cumbersome for me.  I am an older woman.  I ordered this because it has the detachable hand vac which I wanted for carpeted stairs.  The battery one I was using just doesn't do the job.  I find I am using this little Shark most of the time for everything.  It really picks up everything and is light to handle and fits under most furniture so I feel I am getting a better clean.  I am a clean freak by the way.  It is top heavy so you do have to lean it against something if you need to stop during your vacuuming.  However storing is not a problem.  It comes with a hook to hang it on a wall but I just attach the hand vac to the bottom of the vacuum where there is a place for it and it is perfect.  It is small and fits nicely in to my closet.  I absolutely love this purchase!!  I think it picks up more than my full size Dyson.  I do empty the cup every time I use it and the filter is easy to keep clean unlike the Dyson.

    I bought this vacuum on the recommendation of a close friend who has one. I have since recommended it to another friend. Vacuums can be expensive. Finding one that can handle both carpeting and hard flooring is difficult. Finding one that can also be versatile to easily vacuum cobwebs, furniture and other small areas can be impossible! This vacuum is wonderful! We have very old carpeting and after vacuuming my husband and I could FEEL the difference in our carpeting! It felt CLEAN! I'm able to easily go from carpeting to linoleum with the flip of a switch. Vacuuming the hard surface flooring doesn't involve blowing things around - it actually sucks everything up! If you're looking for a reasonably priced vacuum that comes with lots of attachments, is easy to use and store and actually WORKS...THIS is IT!

    Got this vacuum a few days ago. Great suction, convenient in use, cord is appropriate length and attached in the right place - no problem keeping it behind me. The dust cup is on the smaller side - had to empty it several times vacuuming a 1500 sq ft place, but opens smoothly. No issues with it like one other reviewer had. Must have been addressed by now, or theirs was on the lower end of quality chain.For those that want similar (maybe better designed) but with no cord, Dyson stick vacuums are great but cost several times more, and 7-10 min run time on high setting followed by several hour long recharge may not work for everyone.One thing to note: Some people had issues with the unit being ""top heavy"" and falling over during storage. Seems to be operator error. Clearly this vac is intended to be stored with the hand unit attached to the lower end of the stem, via a retention hook for storage, as shown. The weight of the unit puts a forward moment on the stem, making it unlikely to unfold horizontal or detach and fall to the side. Seems like a simple and convenient solution. There are (too) many attachments, some of which are highly useful. There's a bag for them, so keeping them strewn about is not an issue.Materials used make an impression of durability. Hopefully it lasts, but first impressions are very good.

    I’m not one to immediately write a review.  I received my Shark vacuum today and was skeptical. I had one years ago that sucked.  Well, as a vacuum, it didn’t suck.  I needed a lightweight vacuum for our Rv.  It arrived today and took a few minutes to snap it together.  I decided to test it in my home.  We mostly have hardwoods with wool area rugs.  The vacuum seemed a little awkward at first, (I am 5’2). but once I got the hang of it, it was great at getting into tight spaces under chairs.  I had been considering a carpet cleaner for some of my area rugs.  This little vacuum saved me from that.  Rugs that looked dingy were again brighter.  I ran it over our floors and rugs and filled the cup.  (I regularly run a Roomba and occasionally a large vacuum). I ran it a second time and filled the cup again.  I was impressed ( and grossed out!) by how much this little vacuum pulled out of my carpets.  The transition from floor to carpet is not seemless, but the suction power made up for it.  I haven’t tried the car attachment but so far, I’m a fan!

    This vacuum is almost ""fun"" to use. I have been trying it all over the house for about 2 months. It took a few minutes to go through the attachments and set-up. Once I had the connections and functions down, it was so easy to use. We  have a visiting 'grand dog"" and I was amazed at how much hair this vacuum picked up.  Converting the vacuum from a stand-up to hand-held is easy. It works great on wood floors, tile floors, area rugs, carpet, carpeted stairs and wood stairs. It also can reach higher up on to book shelves, window surrounds and ceiling corners. One aspect that Shark may want to consider is a cord that not only disconnects at the wall plug but also from the motorized unit . This would simplify the emptying process when you have to dump out the canister. One would not have to drag the cord along as well while completing this task. The detailing kit is adequate, not super impressive. I think I may have appreciated the under- appliance attachment more. Overall, I am thrilled at the power in this vacuum that is a pleasure to use.

    I’ve only had this for a few days so I can’t speak to it’s longevity yet but I can say I am very pleased with it so far. It was very easy to put the parts together and get vacuuming. I have a small apartment with just one room that’s carpeted but I also have some good quality Turkish/Egyptian/Persian rugs that I like to keep clean. This seems to pick up 100% of the lint, hair, and dirt on the rugs without harming the rugs themselves. It has a cord but I specifically chose this one because of that - I hate having to rely on remembering to charge a vacuum or replacing a battery after a year because it can only hold a charge for five minutes. There is an option to hang this vacuum but I just stick it in my coat closet where it fits easily.

    My Shark Navigator Freestyle was kind of disappointing and weak, but I know Shark is generally a decent brand. I decided to try this one instead. The amount of fur and dirt this thing picked up was disgusting! It's a powerful little vacuum. It picked up everything my other vacuum missed over the course of several months. I just wish it had a bigger dirt holder, but I imagine after using it a few times a week, I won't really need that.

    I read reviews about how heavy the Shark is but so far I am not having a problem.  VERY EASY assembly. VERY EASY if not awkward to empty the dust bin. They need to work on that! I found that it does a very good job on bare floors & was even able to vacuum my throw rugs ( normally shake them outside), I wanted to see how it would do.  Have not yet done my carpet & area rug. I have a very heavy & cumberson Kenmore Elite canister which excels on bare floors & carpeting but I wanted a lighter weight vacuum for in between cleanings.  I will update this review if anything changes.  Right now I recommend this model of Shark.

    This vacuum sucks!!!! LOL. I truly love it, I've had my Dyson now for over 6 years and it is starting to fall apart a little so I was looking to replace it with a rechargeable Dyson when I came across the Shark. Am I ever glad I bought it!!!!! It is very light but extremely powerful. I like how easy it is to switch between rotating and non-rotating brush, all of my house other than my bedrooms is tiled. Make sure there is nothing lying about on the floor, 'cause the Shark will surely suck it up. I love the long cord, before I always had to re-plug, now I can do the whole house as long as I plug in the center hallway. I haven't tried out the car detail kit yet, but as soon as it warms up a bit outside, I will tackle a major car clean up. I also love, love, love how easy it is to move around. the wheels are of a similar material as inline skates and run ever so smoothly across my tile, in addition the pivoting action makes it easy to maneuver around corners without banking up my nice wood furniture. It also is a lot easier to vacuum under my beds and chest of drawers....just squat down and push Sharky under it. I definitely recommend it!

    I purchased this Shark Upright to replace an old Oreck cordless mini vacuum  that we had for over 15 years. It was primarily used for light vacuuming to pick up dog hair and spot messes. Our larger Oreck Upright was used weekly for the main vacuuming. I was surprised to find out that this little Shark is so powerful and versatile that I no longer use the old Oreck. This product comes with a large assortment of attachments and a nice canvas box to keep them in. My only small complaint is that it's not self standing which took a few uses to get used to. I didn't rate it for stairs as we live in a one story ranch style home.

    Since I got this vacuum cleaner  I did not pull out to use any of my kirby's.At the beginning I did not like the fact that1) it does not stand up on its own,2) the head is narrower than the kirby so the shark needs more passes to get the job done,3) never owning a bag-less vac before having to empty all the gunk that it collects it is really gross till you get the hang of it and this was the thing that I hated the most,  but there are so many things that made this shark my favorite vacuum. It is easy to navigate with it, it swivels easily, it gets under most of the furniture just enough to suck out all the dust bunnies. oh and there is not one bit of odor that the vacs with bags leave behind. I am in love with the shark and hope it lasts a very long time as this mamma of a badly shedding springs spaniel needs to vacuum the whole house pretty much every day.

    Our 10+ year old Dyson is one more power up away from not turning on at all. Because all of our house is hard wood or tile (except for a few area rugs) I thought we could get away with a smaller model like this one. We are shocked how much dirt it is picking up.  In the picture, I vacuumed my daughters area rug and room with the Dyson, then grabbed the empty Shark from the hall and vacuumed the same area over again. It filled the Shark up! In a small 10x14 room!  We have only had this a few days, so seems a little slanted to give it 5 stars without being able to speak about its longevity and durability, but based on the amount of dirt it pulled out of “clean” carpet, this baby earned its 5 stars

    This may be the most versatile vacuum cleaner on the market.You can get under couches and chairs and it is so light that you can catch a fly in mid flight!The unit comes with packages of attachments for normal cleaning and for intraquite cleaning. It easily transforms into a hand vac and is very powerful. It has a long cord and stores easily on any wall. It really is perfect.However,  I bought its baby brother as well. Shark makes a chargeable, very light, bagless model # SV1106 which may be the best vacuum cleaner in the world. I couldn't decide so I bought them both. I have a lady that cleans my condo. I have spoiled her rotten!She brings friends over so they can ""play"" with her ""toys! The place never looked better, so why should I complain. If these get ""burned out"" from their ""playing"" I could buy her 2 more sets or 4 more units and not spend what Orkin, Dyson or Kirby charges for 1 unit.

    I’ve been using my Shark Rocket for over 3 years and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. I chose this one as it came highly recommended for hard floors. It completely lived up to the hype. There’s a hard floor dust attachment that I don’t use as the vacuum does so well. I do occasionally need to take out the filters and wash them, but that’s the only time I lose suction. There’s also a pet hair tool that I have found mostly worthless. I just pick up the whole vacuum (which is pretty light) and run it over the surfaces of the couch and it does a great job removing the pet hair that way. I talked my parents into getting one and they love theirs, too.

One is out in the garage, the other two are at two different ends of the house.  With the long cord, I never have to unplug either machine....between the two they cover the whole house.  It is s dynamite vacuum, great suction, light weight, easy to handle, attractive, stores easily.....I love it!  Got one for my daughter and daughter-in-law....and they both love it.

    Great vacuum. I bought a similar Shark vacuum for my other home and it has been working great for several years. This ones is very similar except that it doesn't have lights like my old one did and the dust bin is bigger on that one. However this one was cheaper and is also lighter which is nice. Like my other Shark don't expect this to stand up on its own - it will fall over. However, while that is inconvenient it's worth the benefit of being able to remove it from the pole and use it on furniture and other areas like a hand vac. Also anyone that complains about the cord length has got to be kidding - who wants a short cord to plug and unplug. The cord length on this is a great length.

    Positives:  Suction is great on hardwood, tile and area rug. The cord is a great length.  Quality parts and easy to assemble.  Packaged professionally.  Very easy to empty and clean.  Saves on the environment.  Has it own wall hook and I love organization.  Cord is wrapped manually which I like because I worry about the ones that snap into the machine.Negatives:  Does not stand alone so you would have to lean it against something.  No light but it was not advertised as such so my bad.Shark stands behind the quality of the machine.  It is a good brand.  I was impressed.  I am a Quality Manager and it would have my OK to Ship stamp.

    I have a Roomba but wanted something to vacuum my carpeted stairs, sofas, blinds, ceiling fans and car. The shark rocket does it all!  It comes with several attachments including a kit for car/keyboards, etc.  I had a 10 year old shark navigator but it was clunky for all of the places I need to vacuum.  I vacuumed my stairs and sofa immediately upon arrival and just like the navigator, I filled the cup with hair, my dog's hair. She doesn't like when I vacuum too much, so she's going to her Aunt's house this weekend so mommy can vacuum the hell out of this place!  Under and behind the sofas and all of the places I bought the Rocket for! I've been avoiding lots of spots for far too long and now I'm excited to easily reach them all!Mine did not come with the under appliance tool but I wouldn't have given it a thought if it wasn't in the parts list in the booklet.It was super easy to assemble, you just click the long stick onto the top part and click on your attachment. Take off the stick and click on an attachment for the stairs or sofa.I do wish it stood up on it's own as I don't know where I'm going to hang it, (with included mount) but I will figure that out.I have attached a picture of the micro tool kit and also a picture with a micro tool attached.

Very easy to empty just make sure you do it over the garbage.

I'd buy this again in a heartbeat!ORIGINAL: So, I've only had this vacuum for about five hours, but it's already stunned me. First of all, it was super easy to put together. I did that, and did a quick run around my living room with it. Holy cow! I don't even want to say how much embedded dust and hair it unearthed! It's kind of embarrassing! And you can see it all being sucked up, since the reservoir is clear. It's totally amazing. I knew my previous vacuum was weak, but this is kind of horrifying. Now I'm off to vacuum my house a few dozen more times!!

    I have a cordless Dyson and purchased the Rocket because the Dyson just didn't seem to be doing the job. I think it has something to do with the battery connections getting dusty. I cannot believe how wonderful the Rocket is at cleaning. It does a fantastic job and picks up more dirt than I can to admit! Although I loved having the cordless and not having to worry about the cord getting caught, the corded Rocket does a better job than my Dyson at a much lower cost.

Also, I love that I can vacuum area rugs and not have to take them outside and shake them out.  Saves time!  They would always get caught up in my previous vacuum.

    Wow. I bought a Dyson V6 (which arrived broken). The shark out performs the Dyson in every way, more suction, works better on a variety of floors (the Dyson brush motors would stall on carpet. This vacuum picked up so much dirt on my first few passes at my house today that I instantly knew I made a good choice. The quantity and quality of the accessories is great. All around great vacuum and for the price, couldn't be happier. So what if it has a cord, at least I'm not limited in how much I can clean in one go and don't have to worry about charging. For this price, you can't beat this vacuum. Buy it!

    So far I love this thing. I went a couple weeks with out a vacuum and my bedroom filled up the entire container, and so did my office room. Gross but I think it was pulling dust that was under the carpet that my previous vacuum wasn't strong enough to pull. Make sure you clean it out reguarly and clip the hairs that get stuck on the spinning part that vacuums the floor (no idea what thats called but if you're a female with long hair you know what I'm talking about).

    I needed a vacuum for my new apartment which is all hardwood floors.  I have one small area rug as well.  This works perfectly.  I am rather limited in terms of storage space and this fits perfectly in a small kitchen closet.  Works great for my needs.  Bear in mind that it is small and you need to empty it after every use (at least that's what I have to do).  Make sure you empty it over a garbage can carefully.  If you have heavy duty rugs, this probably wouldn't be practical.  Very happy with purchase.

    Second unit in four years for us. First one was purchased in Oct 2013 from Kohl's. We have bamboo floors with area rugs and a large, hairy dog. We put the unit through (almost) daily use for four years. Sadly, the hose in the base unit developed a crack. I noticed it had a five year warranty and called SkarkNinja. After initially asking me for $99 for a new base unit, we negotiated that if I sent the old unit back (with a prepaid shipping label), they would send a new Rocket True Pet unit (model HV320W) to us for a ~$30 shipping fee. I did and promptly received the replacement. Sadly, it's not nearly as good of a unit as the one I had. It's loud, not as powerful and generally a lower model wrt options (though the light on it is nice).So we have a new (old!) model on the way. The difference in power is a lot. And the old/new model is easier to hold than the True Pet model. The dust bin is easier to empty and doesn't hurt my arthritic hands like the True Pet model. Great unit and easy to use.

    I purchased this lightweight vacuum because my other machine is a Kirby - and don't get me wrong, it's a great machine. But my health has gone downhill and I'm not strong enough to drag that beast up and down stairs anymore. The Shark is an excellent solution. I'm very happy with its use both on bare floors and on carpet. We have mostly tile in our home, but it's great to switch settings and get right to our area rugs and entry mat. The bare floor attachment is stellar. I like the squeeges on it that help scrape up things like rogue price stickers or all the various sticky things my kids drop on the floor.Having said that, I will say I wasn't thrilled with the usefulness for my car. The body of the vacuum is too bulky to get down in small spaces, like under the seats. I would love to have a flexible hose for this.Having a dog and a cat, I am always astonished at how much pet hair this thing sucks up. It's really gratifying.

    I purchased this for doing my stairs. Boy am I glad I did. The weight is very light, the power of the beaters and suction is so much stronger than any battery operated Light Upright.  I use it everywhere. This is my second Rocket, I actually broke the first one, carrying it outside on the sidewalk for my daughter to borrow. I have to say I was so upset with myself, I just taped it and kept using it for about a year with no problems... other than using new tape LOL!I am keeping both. The only thing that could be any better is, being able to unplug the cord from the motor. I would prefer not rolling the cord up every time I need to empty it.

The Rocket is very lightweight, picks up oodles of stuff, swivels effortlessly.and gets under very low furniture.  There are two settings, one for hard floors and one for carpets.  The head has some little tines on it that act as a rake for carpet and fluffs it up as you go.  The only down side I have found is the canister does not hold a lot, so it needs to be emptied several times during a session.  I'm happy to trade that for the light weight the vacuum provides by not dragging around pounds of debris.  Bought one for myself and one for my daughter.  She loves hers as well.

    This is one handy powerful vacuum, I agree that if you are doing your entire house with it the canister is very small and you will be making a lot of trip to the garbage to empty.  I love it because the attachments are very easily changeable and very light weight, I have recently use the carpet attachment on my car mats and after the Wisconsin winters I have to say they came out very nice and clean and then used the attachments to  clean the rest of the inside of my car and it looks great and was easy to get everything.  I know I read in previous reviews that people have taken their current vacuum and then went over it with this one and it still picked up dirt, I have to say to be fair, you can do that with any good vacuum.  I also have a Dyson, I vacuumed with the Shark first and then the Dyson and still picked up dirt and vice versa.  you can even vacuum with the Shark and then go over it with the Shark and still get dirt, however the shark can get places my Dyson is too big for.  I have over the years spent a fortune on vacuum cleaners because I have always had multiple dogs, so I also always have two vacuums at a time and over time they have all lost suction its just that some take longer, so to me buying very expensive vacuums like a Kirby or Rainbow (both min of $1200.00 vacuums) are not worth it as they didn't last any longer then a cheaper one so no need to waist your money.  This vacuum is well worth the $150.00 I paid for it at the Amazon outlet, scratch and dent warehouse, this is also where I bought my Dyson for half price.  Both great vacuums and great values, I would recommend this compact, very powerful Shark to anyone.

    OH. My. GOODNESS!  This vacuum is AWESOME!  I have mostly hard floors and LOTS of long strands of hair - ALL OVER the house.  No previous vacuum has been able to keep up with this kind of abuse and keep suction.  I mostly use the suction head with the dry dust pad, since I have tile floors.  It got EVERYTHING from between the grout, in the cracks and crevices, etc.  I didn't even have to use the crevice tool, although I have some ideas for that, such as window panes, and  behind the fridge.  (I'll  update this post at some point once I've used the accessories.)When I was purchasing, I was a little bummed that it wasn't battery powered, but once I used it, that was never a concern, I'm GLAD it is plug in.  LOTS of power, doesn't die down, long cord and no battery charging or switching.Can't recommend this enough!  Don't hesitate - get the thing, it is awesome, especially considering the price.

    I was debating between Shark Rocket and Dyson. But after using Shark Rocket, Dyson is now more like die son! This vacuum is powerful and lightweight. I was horrified of all the things it sucked up....especially my wife's hair. I could have made a wig and donated it to many people in need of quality wig. I'd much rather have it cord than cordless like Dyson since because the battery life on those will only last a year. 2 thumbs up for now. Let's see after a year.

    After my old vacuum died, this was a perfect upgrade. I can now vacuum my carpets with high power, my rugs with medium power, and my hardwoods/laminate/linoleum with low power. Not to mention, once my work is done in the house, my shark can be assembled to clean my vehicles. The detailing tools make it easy to retrieve dust, dirt, leaves and so on from my vents and interior “running boards.” Capacity is tremendous for such a lightweight device. Stairs are super easy with this design.

    After years using a trusty old Electrolux and a Hoover upright, I was somewhat skeptical of the new tech vacuums.  When the Hoover finally failed last week in the middle of weekly cleaning, I made the decision to order a Shark Rocket.  All I can say is - WOW !  This vacuum pulls dirt from way deep down. It pulled dirt from rugs that had been vacuumed two days before with the old Hoover.  And,  Its size and maneuverability make it Ideal for our home.

    This vacuum is amazing! We really love it. It has so much power and pics up so much dirt and dust! So versatile too. Hangs in our closet on its special hook. Every time my hubby vacuums, we just are amazed at how much dirt it pics up! Seriously, it looks like we had never vacuumed before! Haha! Great control and turning, gets under practically anything.You can remove the long tube and attach the brush directly to the power unit and use it on the stairs, car, tight places.If I can say one 'con' (and it's the only one I can think of) is that it does stand upright by itself. You do have to prop or lay it down OR use the feature where the motor/handle portion detaches and hooks on the lower part of the vacuum.

    I find this much easier and more enjoyable to use than my old upright Dyson. I enjoy the versatility of how you can interchange the parts for either a stick upright or remove the tube and have a tight hand held unit. The suction and dust attachment is awesome on wood floors, getting all my extra pet hair. It does a good job picking up little bits of trash or leaves that blow in. My old vacuum would not pick up anything like that. Downside is that it is top heavy and hard on old shoulders if you are going to use it continuously for a long period of time. It also means it falls over easily. Attachments are all in a bag provided, and to not ""ride"" on the unit. These are small inconveniences for the great performance you get.

    Best Vacuum for the money.  This is the best vacuum I have ever used.  I wanted to say this is the best vacuum ever, but I am a practical person... And therer are probably 500 dollar vacuums that are better than this.  But if you want to spend less then 200 this is the one you should get.  Easy to put together(Two Snaps!)  Easy to use.  Light Weight.  Long Cord.  Lots of attachments.  I paid an extra 25ish bux for the extra attachments.  They are pretty cool, but I probably could have done without.  The vacuum already came with 4 normal attachments, the stuff I aid for are little tiny attachments for getting into super small spaces.  I did clean out my heater vents with one of them and it worked amazingly well.  Oh!  So I have tile floors and several rugs with varying carpet length.  This glided easily from rug to tile with now problem and works well on both types of floors.

    I travel with my dog for work, and let me tell you about this gem!! It’s super light weight! And breaks down into 3 separate pieces making in compact for me to travel with in my car! I bought the extra car detail kit and that is something soooo worth it if you are a clean ocd freak like me! Especially when there is dog hair from traveling! It’s super handy! If your really debating about it, go for it! The suction is great! And easy to clean and empty out!

    I absolutely love my new Shark Rocket!  I use it on my carpet and my smooth floors.  It is light weight and I can easily unhook the head of the Shark and use the wand for quick clean up in crevices of the chairs and couch.  I also love the color choices.  I have the orange one and it is perfect for me!.  The Shark is very powerful and pulls itself forward on the floors.  The cord is long and reaches all the way across my living room without having to stop and plug it somewhere else.  It is easily emptied with just the press of a button.  Anyone would feel good about owning one of these.

    This is the 3rd Shark brand vacuum I have bought and by far my favorite.  The size is great and works just as well as the full size one I have, I rarely use my full sized one anymore.I did have one problem with it, it fell and hit just the right spot to make a spring pop out where you open it to dump it.  It wouldn't stay closed but my husband took a spring from a pen and popped it in there and it is as good as new.The cord length is awesome and it's easy to store and pull it out when needed.  I love how I can reach high very easily and also get into tight spaces.  It would be nice if the canister was a bit larger.  I have 3 kids, 2 dogs and a cat and use this every day.  It's been through a lot and still going strong.

    I never enjoyed vacuuming until I bought this Shark Rocket. I have 1500 sq. ft. of Mirage Nordic Maple hardwood flooring and 500 sq. ft. of white textured ceramic tile upstairs.  It used to take me two days to clean the upstairs but no longer!  The hard surface attachment is perfect!!  If you have a lot of hard surface, my advice would be to purchase extra pads for the attachment.  If you don't you'll be stopping to wash & dry the one pad.  My hardwoods are as close to white as you can get so they need dusted almost every day.  This vacuum is fantastic in every way.  Our finished basement has close to 2000 sq. ft. of low pile commercial type carpet. We just steam cleaned & vacuumed but the Rocket picked up so much more.  It is a little top heavy but that's expected due to how it's manufactured.  It has great power because it took me on a ride, like walking a dog, on our carpet.  Would definitely recommend!!!

    Great vacuum. Glad I bought it. The unit is great at picking up scattered kitty litter, tiny glass beads (my eyeglass chain broke on my all-wood floor), oats, ground coffee, pink lentils, puppy kibble, salt and pepper. It can handle matted cat hair stuck in an entryway rug, as well as wild bird food that drops onto the floor when I feed the winged dinosaurs every day. It is pretty light and comes with some really tiny car vacuum tools, which I haven't used yet.

    I love this vacuum! I cheaped out on my first vacuum and bought an off-brand unit that had barely any power, no features, and broke practically instantly. This vacuum was more expensive (but not by much) and is extremely capable on the deep-pile carpets and hardwood in my apartment. Emptying the dust bin is a breeze and all the attachments mean you can tackle pretty much any nook or cranny you come across. This is super lightweight, no issues operating with one hand, and is extremely compact when stored.

    I never thought I would write a review for a vacuum, but this is no ordinary vacuum!  I have been using sub-standard vacuums my whole life.This one rocks!  It is very light AND self-propelled. It goes completely flat, so you can go under furniture without being a contortionist.  My favorite part is that it even sucks up DUST from my hardwood floors. I will not need to mop as often.  It comes with a plethora of useful attachments and a car cleaning kit.  And you can't go wrong on the price!  Even if you don't need a new vacuum, buy this one to replace what you have.  I love it!

    great light easy to use vac, does the job well and easy to install the piece that you can hang the vac from.  has great suction, maybe not as intense as my previous Dyson, but I am done with Dyson, they're too expensive and honestly this works just as well in my eyes and is half the cost.  The dirt trap is easy to empty and and I love the stair tool and how easy it is to take the wand off use it on stairs or furniture.  my only complaint is that the piece that attaches to the wand to hold the attachments moves around too much when you want to get at the attachments...  BUT, I used lock tite clear glue and now it stays in place perfectly.  I never thought I'd move away from Dyson, but I have learned it's really not necessary to spend 500$ on a a vac.  some would say, you can buy a BMW or you could buy a Chevy, you get what you pay for.  Well, I have both, and guess what, I like my Chevy very much :)

    I am thrilled with this purchase. I previously had a Dyson and although it was good, it wasn't easy to use with regard to stairs or above ground cleaning. I am disabled and have limited use of my hands, but tend to be OCD as far as the cleanliness of my house. I have 2 large dogs that shed. Anyway, I was amazed at the ease in changing attachments and the power of the carpet attachment is incredible! The self propelled head literally tries to run away from you. The swivel head makes cleaning my spiral staircase easy and cleaning above ground is a breeze with just a click! In fact, to test the shark and Dyson side by side, I vacuumed a rug with the Dyson and then immediately went over it again with the shark and was shocked to pick up enough after the Dyson to fill up the cup. The cord is much longer than my Dyson too which makes it easier. I am not overly thrilled with the hard floor attachment, but the other features of this system make it more than worth the purchase price. A good friend of mine saw the vacuum and she was so impressed she teased me that she was going to take it home with her.  I am very pleased.

    They finally gave accessories so I can use them on my other sharks that I've worn out because the hose going from the end of the unit to the carpet rotational device always wears out first and I don't know how to change it out even though I've ordered parts. But I love these units they are lightweight and work real good and I wear them out literally.

    This vacuum was purchased for office space. It works well for picking up scraps of paper staples and other debris from the floor. The suction is very good. It's easy to empty. And seems to be a positive topic of conversation amongst office staff. People love the design and one's day use it they find themselves sweeping the entire office instead of just a space that needs done because it's fun to use.

    LOVE this vacuum! It comes with plenty attachments so you can detail your car and get in all of the nooks and crannies at home. Before, I used a wet n dry vac.. never going back again. This vacuum is super light and small so you can literally go everywhere with it. I vacuumed a whole flight of stairs, three bedrooms, a hallway, a comforter, and my couch. Not once did I need to go over anything. It even manages to get in all of the corners and edges.. Plus it kinda has this swivel technology and it's  super light. I was being lazy and was able to completely pick the vacuum up and vacuum the side of the stairs just like regular carpet. Awkward, but easy and quick. And yes, the cord is long.Anyways, so far this is the best purchase my husband and I have ever made.

    This was an impulse buy for me, I watched the infomercials and was intrigued.  The Dirt Devil was starting to get on my nerves, I was tired of having to pick up pieces it missed.  This vacuum is great!  It takes a little getting used to, since all the weight is on the top.  It's also a pain to remove the cup because you have to drag the 30 foot cord around with you, but it's definitely worth the inconvenience.  I assembled it myself (and I'm a moron) in about 40 seconds.  Would definitely buy again!

    I purchased this vacuum because I was looking for something lightweight. We don't have pets so I was not concerned about suction as much as weight...however, so far I've been very pleased with the amount of dirt this vacuum picks up. The brush head is a little smaller than I was used to, but overall it's OK. The electric cord is a good length...plenty long for my needs. Even thought there is a hard wood floor attachment head, I don't bother to change it and it has not scratched my floors.

A hard floor attachment BUT the carpet head also works great on hard floors, and is AWESOME for carpet.

    I moved into a larger apartment which is half carpet and half faux wood floor. With a quick flick of the switch the Rocket goes from carpet to laminate  without a hitch. It is truly lightweight and I do not get fatigued while vacuuming. Should I need to get something up close to a baseboard I just pop off the unit and it's taken care of PDQ! I don't need to turn the unit off before clicking the unit from the base or placing it back in. The carpet in my apartment was brand new and on the first vacuum I couldn't believe how much drywall dust the unit picked up! My cat is a long-hair domestic and no problem with her fur either. Great for my needs!

    I hesitated buying this vacuum. I have been through so many looking for the perfect vacuum. I have a small house, an upright is too big and canister too clunky. I finally hit the buy button and am very happy I did. It comes with many attachment and I love that I can go right under the beds without having to change to an attachment. Works good on hardwoods and carpet. I got the one with the power cord because I can stand the battery operated ones, they aren't strong enough and run out of time. The cord is long which is good because I only have to change outlets twice, you can get tangled up in it but, you cant have everything!

    Love Love Love this little machine...  First because it is simple... I'm tired of all these fancy vacuums that have too many filters... too many corners for the dirt to go around.. belts for this belts for that.. bags that you have to hunt all around town to find... all which get clogged up or stretched out and you have to purchase continuously.  My old Hoover clogged up so easy that I had to tear apart the whole machine every time I used it or it would just suck in dirt in the front and throw it all over my feet and the floor behind it. This little machine has a washable (or replaceable) filter.. a powerful motor, a container for the dirt and a head to push across the floor or more appropiately ""hang on"" while the suction pulls you across the carpet.Second reason I love it is .. it is lightweight.  I have issues with my back and the bigger ones caused pain when I used them. Twisting and turning trying to get the clunky machines around furniture.  The Rocket practically goes around the furniture itself, you just have to guide it. I have a two story house and I used to have to have two vacuums - one on each level- because I could not haul the heavy ones up and down the 13 step -steep stairway.. This one is so lightweight that it is no problem.Third, the main floor cleaning head is smaller than most vacuums.  I live in a 100 year old renovated house which has lots of smaller spaces, closets, This smaller brush head makes it easy for me to get around the nooks and crannies of this old house and under the antique furniture.  No longer have to get the dust mop out because this machine lays flat to reach way under the furniture. Also it comes with a hard wook floor dusting attachment, with a washable pad... EXCELLENT! Which brings me to the 4th reason.  The attachments... It comes with the regular brush head, the hardwood floor dusting head, three upholstery cleaning heads. One is a velcro type head which is excellent gathering up and getting rid of pet hair.  (We just recently acquired a house cat for the first time and he has claimed a certain chair as his.) And it has a collection of smaller heads for cleaning things like your keyboard and computer fans.  Also is very portable, it will rock in vacuuming the car carpets.Fifth reason is that is is small enough to hang on the wall. It comes with an attachment so you can hang it up and a handy bag for all the attachments. The old vacuums had to be moved here and there because they were always in the way, even in storage.  Being in a 100 year old house, the house wasn't designed for storage of electric appliances and tools.  We had to store it in the porch that goes out the back door and had to move it every time we wanted to go out the door.  This one I can hang in the coat closet .. out of the way. I also love the long cord.  I plug it in in one spot and it reaches my whole house on that level.Sixth reason is the price.  It was affordable for us.  We are on a tight budget and it fit in with that.  No having to go to the bank to take out a loan for something to clean your floor.  It is more powerful than my big clunky Hoover and I will look forward to cleaning now.  If I had larger floors and more spacious areas I may have bought the bigger floor model Shark, but with my smaller spaces and bad back, this is the one for me.

    This is a great little vacuum. The cord is super long, reaches everywhere I need to go. I have tile, carpet, and wood floor in my home. This vacuum works great on all three. The motorized head is very powerful, really gets the pet hair off the carpet. The attachment kit provides every function I could possibly want. The fact that it comes apart and works as a hand-held vac is another great feature. The only down side, if I had to nit-pick, is that the dirt cup is rather small and needs to be emptied frequently. Other than that, I am completely happy with it.

    We recently purchased this upright based on the suggestion of a friend. I wish we had found this Years ago - this is by far the best vacuum we have ever owned. We have had almost all of them, Hoovers, Kenmores, Dysons but this vacuum puts them all to shame. It's cleaning power is awesome, it can get under and around furniture like no other we have owned and it is so simple to empty and clean without the added expense of bags. Do yourself a favor, if you are looking for a vacuum- look no further, this is a 6 star on the 5 star chart. I do not often review a product, but felt we had to review this product, it has made it actually enjoyable to vacuum and it does such an excellent job.

    This thing is great.  I can't believe the power on something this size! I live in an older building that is famous for collecting dust and this thing leaves my floors squeaky clean. After using it, I walked around on floors barefoot and had ZERO dust/debris collect on the bottoms of my feet. And It's many attachments make  harder to reach or size-challenged places so easy to clean.  I unattached the stick, and hooked the powered portion into the main, large cleaning mechanism/attachment and cleaned my stairs more easily and quickly than I have in 3 years.  I attached the small duster / upholstery brush and got all the crumbs out of my couch. dusted the blinds and select countertops, and gave the moldings a good once over.  I love the flexibility of this vacuum, even with the stick on you can still maneuver it all the way under the bed (aka no cumbersome maneuvering of your bed every time you want to clean under it!). The thing is relatively light weight and easy to use, I cleaned two floors (900 sq ft) in a single sitting and didn't feel fatigued whatsoever or that the vacuum was too heavy or hard to handle.  If you're looking for a great vacuum, with awesome suction power, and the flexibility to clean anywhere and everywhere in your home, this is the one for you!!

    I have a 40 foot vacation trailer in Arizona with obviously not allot of room. I needed a vacuum that could get the grit and sand out of the carpet, move easily around small spaces and store in a tiny closet. This was perfect! The cord is long so I plug it in once. It is very well made and comes with all kinds of attachments in a storage bag. Parts click on and off with ease. The rotor bar has two speeds and is easily cleaned and the amount of dirt this thing picks up is amazing. This little vacuum cleaner seriously sucks!

When I tried to use just the hose part to clean a vent it didn't really work, but for the carpet it's totally fine.

    My friend bought this for her home and loved it so much she bought it for her business-she owns a cleaning service. I bought one per her recommendation and love it.I have always hated vacuums and they hate me. I have pulled my back, tripped down stairs and always complain they do not reach an area or they do not have enough power. (the cord on this is the longest of all my appliances)Do not let the size fool you, this baby has power. I used a shop vac on my rugs and then went over the rug with the Shark and the canister was full of dirt the shop vac did not get up. My rugs have never been cleaner.The Dyson-like swivel gives perfect control and the low profile makes getting under furniture a snap.It is also very light weight so you can move a table with one hand and vac with the other. I have found my cleaning time easily has been cut in half.It works on bare floors too and has a Swiffer-like  floor attachment where the first part sucks up the dirt and right behind it its a swiffer pad to get up what was missed.I bought the model that comes with the car attachments and now I can clean my car like a pro...no missed spots because the tools are too big.All parts attach and detach with ease and in logical places, unlike many vacuums.If I had one thing to complain about it would be that the canister is small and has to be emptied frequently but this helps keep the weight down which helps keep my back from hurting so I cannot complain too much. Its even relatively quiet.I seriously could not have designed a vacuum myself any better than this one.I promise you will love it.

    My garage looked like a museum for old vacuums - you name it, I've tried it.  You name it, I've hated it.  The more expensive, the less happy I was with how they worked.  We have a long haired cat and a constantly shedding dog.  No vacuum worked.  They might be good on a rug, but forget the attachment to get the hair off the couch.  If it was good on a rug, you could bet it didn't work on a wood floor or tile.  This vacuum works great on everything and I don't need to see the chiropractor or acupuncturist after I use it.

    Bought for a finished basement room that has vinyl plank flooring and carpeted stairs - this was a great choice.  Overall I don't use it in a very large space so the small-capacity dirt canister is a non-issue for me.  Transitions easily from hard floor to carpet. I remove the long wand and attach the handheld piece directly to the vacuum piece and it is the best and easiest way to vacuum carpeted stairs EVER!! I like it so much for stairs that I even carry it up from the basement to the 2nd floor to vacuum those stairs too. It picks up lots of dirt, crumbs, dog hair too.  Shark makes the best vacuums.

    This is the best vacuum cleaner I have ever had.  It has every feature I have ever wanted.  It is lightweight. The cord is up high so it is easy to manage.  It empties very easily.  If it runs over the cord it doesn't get caught in it.  I had just vacuumed a few days ago and when I used this one I had to empty it 3 times.  Incredible.  It has all the attachments you could ever want.  It even has mini attachments for your computer and such.  It has a great feature for storing it on the wall.  It has a separate head for bare floors.  I got it with my prime which made it cheaper than anywhere else and I had it in 2 days.  I would highly recommend this vacuum, in fact, I already have. Just as good as a dyson and a whole lot less expensive.  It also breaks down into a hand held vacuum.

    I really like this vaccum.  I tried several before I settled on this one.  One of the others left a beater bar mark on my camper floor, where it kept running while I vaccumed the stairs. I was pretty mad and returned it.  The Shark Rocket is perfect for my 5th wheel camper and stores very easily in my small closet.  It has two settings for the speed of the beater bar.  1) for the carpet cleaning and 2) for area rugs, it doesn't suck them in to the vaccum.I took it into the house to test it on my carpet and it was great. It is even propelled drive.  Although it took did take me longer to do the job because it is smaller than a regular vaccum. It picked up pet hair great, and with all the attachments there's nothing you can't use it for.

    LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Shark!  We recently put in hardwood floors but still have carpet in the bedrooms!  Also have carpet on the entryway stairs, and they are so hard to clean when you have 2 steel rods in your back!  I have purchased so many different types of vacuums to make this easier on me and FINALLY found one that is PERFECT!!!  With just the click of a button, you can release the floor head and have a long suction pipe, or you can take the floor head and longer pipe off for just the handheld part!  You can switch from carpet to hard surface with the flip of a switch!  I can clean my whole house with this amazing machine!  In fact, I loved it SO much after using it for a week, I sold my Dyson!

    Works well, but the motor and grip area at top of wand is heavier than what was expected.  It's a bit wearying and wearing on the arm to lug that critter about for very long.  Also, the unit will not stand up by itself-at least we haven[t figured out how to make it do so.  But the vaccumming aspect--as expected- Quite powerful.  Gets under tables, chair and higher couches, beds with no problem.A child could not handle this unit.

    This is by far the best vacuum I have ever used.  You can see the nap being revived the first time you use this vacuum, the motor in the base is a great idea.  I am amazed every time I use it as to how much fine dust/dirt and dog hair it picks up and how fresh the carpets look.  The smaller head allows you to get around  furniture easier than the full size vac and you can get under so much furniture with the slim design.  I can do more easily with this little guy and the attachments that came with it than I could with any of my upright vacs.  I would recommend this vacuum to everyone. You have to dump the bin often, but I'd rather do that than loose suction having a fuller dirt bin (it will gross you out how much stuff is in your carpets, on the furniture, anywhere you use it.).

    This vacuum surprised me. I thought it would work, sure. If I thought otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. But the build quality, the strength of the materials, the attention to detail - all combine to make this one sweet sucker. Of course, it does the vacuuming part quite well. The bare floor attachment is exactly what I need! I have 2,000 sq/ft of tile floors, and three long hair cats. I need to vacuum about 3 times per week. This little gem makes that job fast and effective. The suction is fantastic and the powered head works very well. It pulled dirt out of the carpet that my other 'pet' vacuum didn't even touch. The collection cup needs emptied a couple of times during a whole-house cleaning, but that doesn't bother me at all.There is a video review here: http://youtu.be/zW7CTY-4KZA

    The amount of dirt this vacuum picks up is amazing! I have both carpeted and non-carpeted floors in a studio apartment.  I can't believe I have been living in an apartment with so much dirt embedded in it.  I use the hand vacuum on my mattress and furniture, with the stick for the floors.  My apartment even smells cleaner.  I have only been using this product for about a month, but I love it.

    I love this vacuum!!  yes the dustbin needs to be emptied often but so what.  It obviously is cleaning a lot of of dust and grit off the floor which is my main concern.  I agree with a previous review that it's strength is on hard floors.  Yes you can use it on rugs but I think I'm going to be using my rainbow on the rugs and the shark on my hard floors.  I have no carpet in my house now (thank god).  I may buy a different, more powerful,  shark for my rugs.  Will see.  I am a fan of shark now.

    Used it for the first time and was very pleased, the suction was terrific, the amount of dirt it pulled from my bedroom carpet filled the cup completely from just one room, my old vacuum never seemed to pull that much. Emptying the cup is so easy just put a small plastic bag under and release the cover, done. It is a little awkward until you get the hang of it. But once you get going it is so light and easy to push around, I found it easy to use, easy to change the heads. I do wish it had a floor brush for hard wood floors, but the duster floor brush seemed to work very well. I did buy the longer dusting brush that did not come with my purchase. I will be using it on my next cleaning. Would buy this again, great value for the price!

    Alright, listen up. If you are thinking about buying a Dyson, DON'T!!! get this one instead. It's a little heavier but the Dyson was SO delicate. Really, every time I touched it, something would stop working on it and when we called support, they would scold us. The brush attachment at the end of the wand  just stopped working, they sent us another, it stopped again they sent another but they said they wouldn't again, What a crock!.

    Excellent vacuum cleaner.  I used this device right after vacuuming with a Hoover upright, and it was amazing how much stuff it got up.  And when the dirt cup filled up, I was able to take it over to the trash can, pop the hinged cup open, empty the dirt, and keep going.  Bye-bye filter bags, loss of suction, inability to get under low objects with the old upright.I'm a 66-year old guy, and I ended up buying this for myself (my wife said don't ever buy her a new vacuum cleaner again).  But now I get to do all the vacuuming.  I'm still not real sure who got the better end of this deal. :-)

    I own two. One for my home and one for my office. My Dyson was so big and heavy I couldn't use it after back surgery, and my Roomba pulls up carpet fibers. The Shark does a great job and I love the weight and maneuverability. I never have to move chairs, and vacuuming under the bed is a cinch. The filter was easy to clean. It's super loud, but I don't care. I have to empty the canister often, and the cord isn't as long as the Dyson's was, but personally I don't mind that either.

    This Shark Rocket is so powerful that it fills up the small container real fast. Every time I empty it I feel I could make a little kitty out of the dog hair it picks up. I have a Lab dog and everyone that has that breed know how they shed their hair. That was such a problem for me. Now I just leave the Rocket in a corner because I use it so much. No use to put it away. I am elderly, so it dose make my neck and shoulders hurt, but in time I think that may go away as my body gets used to using it. It is very easy to use and empty. It is self propelled when using on the carpet, so that is great. I recommend it very much.

    Why did I wait so long! What a fun and very effective vacuum cleaner! I absolutely cannot believe how much stuff it is getting out of my carpets! I had a Shark up right before and it didn't even come close to pulling what I'm seeing in that canister as I dump it.  My carpets actually look like I shampooed them.  The attachment to do the hardwood floors is divine. It sucks up the cat food, the cereal and all the trash plus dusts the floor with the pad while I'm doing it.  This saves me the extra step of going and grabbing them up after I vacuum or sweep.  No more brooms and dust pans for me!  It is extremely light and hangs on the wall which saves me space in my laundry room where I was storing my upright vacuum.  The cord is super long which saves me the extra step of unplugging and plugging in when I go through my 2000 square-foot house.  My children really enjoy using it too which is always a plus!  Great price considering you also get so many attachments with this device ordering it here. I noticed when I was shopping for it in other companies you spend a little bit more and do not get all of the extra accessories. I couldn't be happier!

    This thing ROCKS!  I vacuumed my carpet with my old upright and it collected the usual amount of dirt. I then followed this immediately with the Rocket and it collected twice the amount of dust and debris. No complaints about its power and suction. The collection bucket is easy to empty over a trash can.  The only drawbacks are the fact that it doesn't stand upright on its own (you have to lean it against a wall or piece of furniture) and the attachments must be kept separately (in a supplied bag). But these are minor complaints given its cleaning power.

    I have used Shark vacuums for many years  and have loved every one.  However, this upright is my favorite.  It is so user friendly and glides over carpeting with ease.  The Only thing I do not like is--if you are in the middle of a room and want to turn it off and leave it unattended for a minute , because it is top heavy, you have to lay it down.  It does not stand alone.  The attachments are really great and the mini attachments fit in the tiniest places.  My dryer vent has never been so clean.  I would recommend this model to everyone.

    So happy with this purchase.  It is super easy to use- the attachments go on and off easily and it is lighter than I expected.  The hard floor tool with the dusting pad is so great- like a vacuum and swifter in one- gets floors super clean.  It fits under the furniture with ease and the swivel head moves around furniture legs etc very easily.  This is perfect for people (like me) who have pets and need to vacuum every couple days to keep up with the dog fur.  Much easier than getting out a big vacuum- and why bother- this works just as well as the dyson animal that I paid at least twice as much for.  The carpet attachment works great and will even do the area rugs without pulling them up off the floor.

    The long cord is great.  The machine swivels and maneuvers so most tight spots can be reached.  It's light weight, has great suction, and is easy to dump the dust (outside).  The beater bars when used on the low speed are OK for smooth floors too, but also work well on smoother rugs, cushions, mattresses, etc.  High speed really cleans and lifts the pile on carpet.  I also like the dust away attachment on the hard floors.  It seems to get the dust that may be more stuck to your wood floors.  This vacuum has made it much quicker and easier for me to clean house.

It has rubber bumps on the container part to put against the wall so it wont fall over when not in use, it works wonderful! It is top heavy and wont stand upright by itself but if you put the container part against the wall, etc. it will securely hold your vacuum. The cord is long! Longer than the older model we had, which is so nice. I love the handle, it is so comfy! This seriously makes vacuuming the house much easier and faster!!!!!

    Love my Shark Model HV302.  It goes from wood floors to carpet with just a touch of a button on the handle and does a good job on both surfaces. Having the motor and canister in the handle makes the ""business end"" light and maneuverable.  It also becomes a hand-held vac with a simple change of attachments.  The arrangement puts a little more weight in the hand compared to my previous upright vacuum, but I've adjusted to that.  Emptying the canister and rinsing the filters couldn't be easier.  (I don't have pets, so I can't speak to the pet-hair issues.)  A great value in my opinion.  I would recommend this vacuum to any of my friends.

    Recommended by a friend who owns a lodge and cabins.  Everything I hoped for. WONDERFUL for stairs and under beds. Can't believe the combination of light weight and strong power.  The swivel head allows one to go from side to side on the stairs and around the legs of the beds.

    Love the vacuum. My girls help me out sometimes and they say it’s easy to maneuver. They like emptying the contents which makes it easier for mom. I love the long cord and all the attachments. I especially love that I can use it on bare floors as well as on carpet.

    This vacuum is FANTASTIC!!  Two adults, 3 children and 3 dogs live in our home on 76 acres of woods. Can we say we get a TON of dirt on our floors!!  This little vacuum has amazing power and does a fabulous job of leaving the floors free from dirt and hair. My favorite cleaning tool.

    Pros-LightweightNever loses suctionAwesome attachmentslong cordIt picks up Pug hair like its no body's business...seriously if you own a pug you probably have killed 2 or 3 vacs due to the hair alone. This picks it up with no problems. I've had it a little over a month and I don't miss our Black and Decker.Cons-The container doesn't hold a lot so during big jobs you have to empty it a lot. And the placement of how you empty it is a little awkward. However if it works like it does a year from now I can ignore this.

    Love our Shark RocketUltra-Light.  It has powerful suction and is much easier to carry from one floor to the other in our tri-level home.  The storage bracket also makes storage easier.  The auto detailing kit included helps to vacuum the heat/AC vents as well as other hard to reach areas.

    I got this for in-between pickups and for furniture and higher places. Places I can't reach that are off the ground.Does a pretty good pickup on those things. I have 3 dogs and one sheds constantly, this gives me a change to catch most of it before it hides or gets ground into the rug. Lets me get up at the ceiling height  to get cob webs or spiders. I am going to get their bigger attachment kit for the duster that can be angled. Also it's great size and weight to use in the Motor Home when traveling.

    Best upright I've ever owned. It's versatile and easy to use. It does a great job on hard wood floors and low pile area rugs. I do not use it for deep pile carpets - I have a Kirby for that. I was surprised by the variety of attachments that came with it and by the ease with which they can be attached. It swivels easily around furniture and can be laid flat to get under cabinets. The dusting head vacuum attachment is excellent. Also, the 30' cord is a big plus. I would recommend it highly.

    This vacuum exceeded my expectations. It's very powerful and very easy to use. It has a very long cord which I really like. I can vacuum all of my kids' rooms without having to unplug and replug the cord. The multiple attachments are very easy to switch out and have great features within themselves. The only thing that would be a great change for a future model is a detachable cord so it's easier to clean out. However, I still think this was a great purchase.

    I was looking for something that I can easily maneuver on stairs, as well as use on area rugs. The Shark Rocket is great; easily comes apart to do a variety of cleaning on stairs and furniture, or use as an upright. As an upright, be sure you are holding on to it; since it is weighted at the top, it seems to want to take off on its own. And you can't stand it upright on it's own since it is top weighted in this configuration. But the ease of use on the stairs and furniture makes this a must have, plus it works great on pet hair.

    I bought this to be the second vacuum for use in the lower level (basement) of my home. However, it is so light weight and maneuverable that it has become my main vacuum! It is easy to carry up the stairs to the main level and much easier to use than my big upright.

    An amazing tool. Whereas the suction does not seem overtly strong by covering the tube orifice with my palm, the amount of material the vacuum collects is nonetheless amazing. It is most evident when doing carpets. I don't know if the motorized head is teasing out more fibers than my old vacuum or what, but the chamber gets filled in no time. I would definitely vacuum with a plastic bag on my wrist so I can empty the holding chamber frequently. I would also have a moist towel handy to wipe the outside of the vacuum after dumping the chamber, or else I would be looking at all that fine dust that floats up during the emptying process.  It's best to change to different attachments with the motor body supported on a flat surface.

    Picked this up because we were tired of our cheap little vacuum not doing its job. We would constantly vacuum our rugs and after a once through with this, seeing all the crap that was left behind from the other vacuum was amazing.

    Purchased the cordless Dyson first and it was substandard... broke after the third use. Decided to give this Shark a try even though it had a chord, and it rocks. The cord itself is long which is great. There is no hiding the cord, nor does it retract. You have to wrap it up around the traditional hooks. Shark could have thought this through better. That all said, it is a great vacuum. Great price.

    This vacuum is light-weight, has powerful suction, and comes with lots of attachments. My apartment is a mix of hardwood, carpeted, and vinyl floors and I can clean them all with this vacuum. The attachment for cleaning upholstery is great too.Only con I can really think of is that the dirt trap can fill up quickly, but I still manage to clean my whole 2 bedroom apartment before needing to empty it. If you have a large home or lots of carpet you might need to empty several times.

    I previously owned several cordless stick vacuums for vacuuming stairs on my three-story condo.  The cordless stick vacuums were convenient (no cord), lightweight, and very maneuverable.  But they were also very inconvenient because I couldn't vacuum more that 20 minutes before the battery ran out.  After going through 3 cordless vacuums in 4 years, I got discouraged and felt bad about sending them off to the landfill.This time I decided to buy a corded vacuum so that I would not have to hassle with the short-battery life.  The Shark Rocket stick vacuum was highly recommended on this site, so I bought it.  I have had it for 3 months.I was immediately impressed by the incredible power that a corded vacuum gives over a battery vacuum. I was surprised by how much dirt the vacuum sucked up. Dumping the dirt is amazingly easy ... just push a button and it falls out into your trash can.  No disposable filter bags, and no cloth filter to clean.I was also amazed by how many attachments came with it!  It is going to be a very versatile vacuum ... not just for my stairs, but also for baseboards, cars, and hard to reach places.  There's plenty of power to suck up dirt in those places.Since it is a stick, it is easy to maneuver, especially with its swivel head.  The cord is super long so I don't have to unplug-replug it to cover a large area.The motor is at the top and is a bit heavy.  It is just part of the design to allow it to work with all the attachments.  It is true that it does not just stand up on its own. It can be leaned against a piece of furniture if it is on soft furniture and carpet, but otherwise needs to be laid down as you work around a room and need to move pieces of furniture.  I have not assembled the wall mount yet, so I lay it in a spare bedroom when not in use.Some reviewers said that this vacuum has too much power, that it kind of takes off out of your hands.  I suppose that it true.  But the power is one of the things I like most about it.  Because of the power, the pulling feature, and the swivel head, the vacuum doesn't go back and forth in neat straight lines.  For vacuuming large carpeted rooms, I will use my conventional upright which I believe is better at going back and forth in straight lines and getting up against the walls.For me this will be a specialty vacuum for stairs, baseboards, and hard to reach places.PROS:  powerful; long cord; many versatile attachments; easy to dump; swivel head and narrow size for maneuverability; no battery which would send it to the landfill; good for stairs/baseboards/hard-to-reach-places.CONS:  doesn't stand up on its own; power pulls the vacuum forward; power and swivel head means that it doesn't go back and forth in straight lines; bit top heavy.I am very happy with this purchase.

    We have a solid upright vacuum which is fine for most purposes but even with the attachments, doing the stairs and under the bed is REALLY a chore and not very effective. I posted a question in the community section asking about how this Rocket does under the bed, and I was so pleased to receive a bunch of prompt and all positive replies. I was convinced and bought this Shark. We are so happy with this little powerhouse. It easily glides under the bed completely and the stairs are much easier to handle. I can't believe how much stuff this machine picks up given its light weight and maneuverability. Of course, the dust cup is not huge and I am pleased to empty it out (simple task) after it's done a good job picking up so much. It has a roller brush and two settings: hard floor or carpet. The attachments make it useful for all aspects of household cleaning. I would consider it a supplemental vacuum, not the basic machine for an average home. But it is SO easy to move around and use. Also, the handheld vac is much more powerful than our other one

    I've had this vacuum for 3 years.  I'm buying another for my parents home.  It's super compact, easy to use, long cord, cleans great and pivots nicely against walls and under furniture.

    I LOVE this vacuum it is well made, and has excellent suction.  I was worried about the cup that it would fill up quickly but in fact it does not, and it is larger than I thought it would be.  I really like how the top comes off for storage and just hangs onto the lower portion and then you can wrap up the cord.  Highly recommend, and I have four kids and vacuum constantly!!

    This is the best vacuum that I have ever owned.  It is light and the long cord affords me the ability to use it all over the house without ever changing sockets.  It is easy to clean and all of the attachments are so beneficial.  Love it and recommend it!

    I couldn't believe all the 5 star ratings but it is certainly worth it.  I've replaced my old clunky Dyson with this unit and it OUTPERFORMS!  I am very happy and the price was well worth it.  (The people who don't want to empty the canister shouldn't buy this product.  I certainly don't mind and it shows how much suction power this small unit has.)  I recently had back surgery and can lift and move this product.

    Having used some of the so called ""Best"" vacuum cleaners ever made etc., I was and am still blown away by this machine!  I had my own cleaning business for 25 plus years and know more than a thing or two about what makes a great vacuum and what is just hype!!  I have seen people buy worthless piles of crap just because it was expensive...therefore it must be good right? NOPE!I have been searching for something that was not too expensive, smaller, easy to use and versatile, as I have all hardwood floors and one large area rug with low pile.  Dragging in a canister vac every couple of days really gets old and my OCedar microfiber push broom doesn't do the one carpet I have!  I could not bring myself to plop down $300.00 for a Dyson either!  I bought this on Cyber Monday for less than $112.00!There are so many different attachments that come with it, I still have not used them all!  I was astounded at what it pulled out of my area rug, well disgusted is more the word!  The first use was impressive, but every day after that was well ridiculous!  The deep down fine dirt that it pulled out, every day for 2 weeks, blew me away!  Again, I was a professional housekeeper with my own business for 25+ years, I sweep with my OCedar everyday sometimes twice.  Granted, I no longer have small children and a big dog running thru the house everyday, but my family still has no clue what wipe your feet or take them shoes off means!  So being able to switch from the power head to the bare floor attachment as easily as you can and with such a long cord....I love it!  Wish I had bought two!  Or even three!  I know a couple of family members who could use a machine like this!

    I am extremely happy with this vacuum cleaner. It is indeed very light, but absorbs twice as much as my old and a lot heavier Samsung. I cleaned with my Samsung first and, then, with the Shark. The Shark picked a lot of hair and dust after the Samsung. Also, putting it together is super simple, just two clicks away. It is a bit noisy, but I can live with that, because it does a great job.

    I got suckered into an infomercial on the Shark Rocket when I was in the hospital recently for MS.  Not much to do in the early hours ... so I watched this.  I was amazed but wasn't sure if this vacuum could live up to the hype.We live in FL in a tiled Villa with area rugs.  This little gem is light (just about 8 lbs) and has a super long power cord.  There is a lot to like about this little vacuum and having owned a Dyson DC-28 ""the Animal"" (sold it in a move) this little bugger does a pretty darn good job without all the weight.  We have cats and I was extremely impressed with how well it works.  The canister is smaller, so you may need to empty it more - but the emptying mechanism is easy.The vacuum is easy to maneuver, super light, very agile and really does a great job.  Just when I think I have found my vacuum ... this one does the trick.  As a person with a medical issue ... this makes it a bit easier to use.  I've eyed the Dyson version of this type of vacuum but just couldn't pass up trying another brand.  I have to say, this one is built very solidly.Great purchase .... happy camper.  5 stars!I bought the version with all of the attachments.

    Recv'd my Shark Rocket just yesterday -- OH BABY, BABY, what a powerful lit'l work horse!  For many, many yrs I've owned a commercial grade Kirby vac at my primary home in CA; bought this one for my townhome in NC.  I notice very lit'l, if any, difference in performance/suction w/ this in comparison to my Kirby.  A couple yrs ago I purchased the Dyson DC44 for the townhome and recently it began having small issues.  While there are a couple of features I really like about my Dyson, e.g. slightly lighter weight, and it's quicker handling 4 sucking up fast moving bugs, spiders, etc (aways power ready--no having to plug in), overall, the Shark simply puts the Dyson to shame!  That's particularly true w/ carpet cleaning where my Dyson is just useless.  I definitely don't see any justification for the mega cost of the Dyson;  the Shark offers waaaay more for the money!  Now, I can only hope that the Shark turns out to be durable!

    This vacuum is awesome. For years my wife bought really expensive vacuums, but when she left she took them with her and I was left to find one for my condo ;-). This is better than any we ever owned. I've recall most of the negative reviews had to do with the cord - sheesh, think about what our mother's had to do to clean the house! Anyway I can't imaging a better vacuum cleaner; works well on my rugs, carpet and hardwood floors.

    Originally I had the base model of the Shark Rocket for myself back in the summer of 2015. I am glad that I bought the Shark Rocket because it made vacuuming smaller carpeted rooms like the bedrooms and hallway on the second floor of the house a lot easier. Getting under the bed and other furniture I cold now do without having to move the furniture around, big plus. And now cleaning the carpeted stairs was much easier to do.Last December my Mom and Dad were looking for a new vacuum cleaner so I lent them mine for a month. Both Mom and Dad became comfortable using this vacuum very quickly. My Mom said this vacuum was light on her wrists. My Dad said that using this vacuum to clean the carpeted stairs in their house made his life a lot easier. Both like the suction power. So for Christmas my sister bought them the the basic model.My sister and brother in law themselves were also looking to purchase the True-Pet version of Shark Rocket around the same time. And again after using the basic model I lent my parents, they too wanted one. So my Mom and myself got her and her husband one for Christmas. I haven't asked my sister about how her vacuum is holding up, but my Mom and Dad still use their to clean the whole house. They say it still works as good as the first time they used it out of the box.After thinking about the TruePet version with the LED lights on brush head and the removable dust cup, I decided to purchase one. With the basic model, I had to""drag"" the vacuum or just the corded motor part over to the garbage to dump the collected dust into the garbage. Not with the True-Pet, now I just remove the dust cup and take that and dump the contents into the garbage. The LEDs on the motor head is another feature that has made my vacuuming easier because the LEDs add light where it's most needed, right in front of the motor head.The reason I got the True-Pet version when I did instead of the another model was because the price that I purchased it at was lower in cost than the other models that I looked at. I got lucky because True-Pet also came with the detailing kit.So the basic Shark Rocket that I had, I cleaned out the vacuum as best as I could and hand washed the filters clean. Then gave it to my other sister. She said she has gotten a lot of good use out of it since I gave it to her last January.

    The Absolute BEST vacuum I have ever had.  Love it more than my Dyson.  Only thing is, I have fibromyalgia and it sometimes affects my fingers/hands and this can get a little heavy after awhile, if I am doing the entire house at once.  This is due to the distribution of the weight (all at the top.)  Otherwise, PERFECT.

    Oh gosh I don't know where to start...I had a different (very expensive brand) vacuum, but as my arthritis began to make it difficult for me to maneuver and carry this machine, I started looking for something else.  After reading the reviews of the vacuum, I decided to give it a try.  I am not disappointed.  It is lightweight, I can use it easily on my stairs, and it is so versatile that I have yet to find anything that I can's clean with it.  I love the large assortment of attachments--AND they are easy to attach and remove, and they don't slide off when you are using them (another problem with my old vacuum).The only problem with my particular unit is that one of the attachment clips is difficult to use--I have to press down on the motor unit to get it to connect firmly, and when I want to disconnect it, I have a bit of difficulty getting it pressed down to release (another problem for someone with arthritis).  But that would not be a problem for most people, and it's not enough for me to take away a star.  I just wish it worked as well as the one on the bottom of the wand.

    BUY THIS VACUUM, it's AMAZING!  Easy to assemble, quality seems good, but the best surprise was when we started vacuuming.  First off, we live in the country with sand, but take off our shoes in the house.  Living room is hardwood with an 8x10 area rug.  We had just vacuumed the rug with previous vacuum.  Husband started vacuuming with the new Shark Rocket, and WOW...the canister filled up with one pass.  Shocked at the amount of sand and dog hair, we dumped it into a container, and he went back for a 2nd pass, which filled canister again.  Amazed, he repeated for multiple passes and dumps into container, (much to the thrill of wife) and ended up with over 1# of sand-dirt and hair...the volume was about the size of a 1# tube of ground turkey.  This was all in ONE 8x10 area rug, which did not even appear dirty to us.  Husband fist-bumped my purchase and we cannot praise this vacuum enough. We haven't even used the hand tools yet, but they look quality.  We ordered the vacuum with the smaller auto-crevice tools also, and they are adorable, skinny, and look able to get into any crevice, with the flexible hose.  Buy it...just do it...you will NOT be disappointed. OH it also has a LONG power cord, which impressed us as well.

    Love it! Works like a dream. Super easy to use, the best part is that there's no vacuum bag to replace. Simply push the lever and the debris empties into your trash, then snap back in place. Really lightweight.

    ""Shark!"" They have come a long way.  This vacuum cleaner works much better than Dysons.  It is strong and easy to clean.  I am satisfied with the performance.  They just need to enhance the grip design.  I have to wear a glove not to get a blister.  The grip handle material is good, but the shape has the problem.

    I love this little vacuum.  I was amazed at the amount of crud you vacuum up in a short time.  You do have to empty the container often, but if you're accumulating that much that quickly, rejoice.  You're not having to breath it. It does way more than I have tried yet - I have hardwood floors and area rugs, some ordinary, some Oriental.  You zip around without changing floor attachments - simply push a 1 or a 2 on the control.  You can work very quickly, and it goes under a lot of your furniture.  Oh - I also have a big parrot, so she leaves dust, feathers, and nut shells in her wake.  This thing goes under her stand, doesn't make an awful lot of noise. I might add that for its being able to suck up so much stuff, it doesn't swallow your rugs, and it doesn't suck up its own cord, like bigger, more expensive vacuums.  It is such a cute small size, too.  It is cheap enough you can buy more than one, store in convenient locations.

    Love this.  Don't like dragging the cord around, but that is the price I pay for not wanting to lose suction.  I also don't like that I have to grab the entire cord and carry it outside to clean the canister.  Wish there was a way to unplug the cord from the unit at the base as well.

    I was amazed at the amount of dust, dirt, hair that came out of the first use of this vacuum.  Always thought my old vacuum was doing a good job but this machine proved me wrong on that.  Only minor objections are the fact that it will not stand on it's own when having to change the receptacle it's plugged into and that you have to unplug and haul cord along with dirt cup to empty if waste container is not within range of cord.  These are really minor inconveniences that I can live with due to excellent job this vacuum does at cleaning.

    Where do I start? This has got  to be the best vacuum I have ever owned and being 62 trust me I have owned a few in my lifetime. I had purchased the shark  cordless and fell in love with the shark brand. When my vacuum went out and decided to give this shark vacuum  a try and I am so pleased that I did. Never will I buy anything but the Shark brand. This vacuum is perfect for me and my needs. It is light weight which is good for me being disabled I no longer have to try and drag a heavy vacuum around with me. The storage is ideal as t fits flat  on the wall behind a door which is another big plus for me. I had to apologize  to my husband that he had been walking around on such dirty carpet after all this one had picked up. All this time I thought my carpets were cleaner then they were. This vacuum suction out beats any vacuum I have seen .

    All I have to say is WOW! This thing has some power to it. I have been using a Dyson upright for 5 years now (one of the ball Dysons) and this thing is just as good if not better. The floor vacuum attachment that is in the photos...when I turned this thing on it pulled me across the room! I bought this thing primarily as a ""dustbuster"", and it does more than just minor cleaning. I bought the motorized brush attachment separately from the Shark website...and if you need pet hair vacuumed off your furniture, that's what you need. My furniture looks brand new after giving it a once over with this thing.I haven't tried the Dyson version of this (DC35 or DC59), but I can't imagine these being any better than the Shark. I'd say at best they could equal the power of the Shark Rocket Ultralight, but at the price, Shark wins.Also, the colors are very sleek. That's something that Dyson had on Shark in previous models. Now, this guy looks as sharp as a Dyson, and works just as well. Stop fighting it and buy it already. You won't regret it.

I'm not very strong so it was a little bit more effort than I thought it would be to pull it back and keep it upright, but I think it's worth it. I vacuumed a few carpets in the house one at a time and boy, the amount of dirt and hair it picks up is ridiculous. Emptying the collection canister is easy, so is attaching and detaching parts and the click the tools make when they slide into place is so satisfying. That sounds weird. Whatever.Highly recommended!

    I bought this vacuum mostly for being able to vacuum under my beds since they are too heavy to move. I was amazed at how well this vac did. I had so much dust under that I was shocked.I've used it for getting edges and cleaning other difficult areas my other large vac can't. I think this is an exceptional item. Am very glad I did buy it, even if it was part of my Christmas gift.

    I've put off getting a new sweeper because we had a Bosch. We thought it was doing a great job. Boy, were we wrong. This little vacuum is amazing. It kinda makes me disgusted to know how much dirt is in my carpet; or I should say WAS in my carpet.

    I just bought my second Rocket so that I have one at home and one for our second home. I have a big Dyson which has been my primary vacuum at home but it is so heavy to lug up and down the stairs of our 3 story house and I have loved the Rocket in use at our second home. It is affordable and works as well as the high priced Dyson.

    I've got to tell you I'm really surprised that I'm writing a positive review but I just have to do this. I have bought shark products in the past and I promise myself each time never again. This is since shark originally came out and they just always disappointed me. I thought after reading the reviews I'm going to try ""just one more time!"" Famous last words. I'm so impressed with my shark right now I wish I could have one on each floor, but then again it's so light it's no problem carrying it up and down between floors. The power it has to actually clean is  shocking to me.I can't tell you how many I've had and regretted having in the past but this new one really makes up for all those losses.I don't know if it's a new design internally or someone bought the company or whatever. That means nothing. I just want something light with the power to actually suck up the dog hair and dirt and keep on working. I think I've got it. Now I know why they can compare to Dyson. Now I know why they say they're better. I have a Dyson by the way.

    I purchased the Shark Rocket about a month ago (from BB&Beyond due to the 20% coupon but based on reviews I read here).  I was somewhat skeptical since I tend to gravitate toward reading the 1- and 2-star ratings first, propelling myself into a state of doubt over even the most minor purchases.I was looking for something to replace a heavy, somewhat useless Hoover upright purchased in 1999 and an older model Shark that's no longer sold (as far as I can tell).  The Hoover was on the way out the door for a variety of reasons but primarily due to it's weight and the fact that it didn't really suck much up.  The older Shark was okay but wasn't powerful enough and it was a pain to detach the handheld part (awkward to get off the main frame).  It also didn't have a powered head (or whatever that bottom part is called) so it really wasn't that effective on carpet.  I would usually use the brush attachment with the handheld to clean my area rugs (on my knees).We live in a tri-level house (so wanted something lightweight to drag up and down the stairs) and have mostly hardwood/tile floors with area rugs and one room with wall-to-wall carpet (so I needed something to easily transition from hard surface to carpet).  I compared multiple models but was sucked in (haha) by the Shark Rocket infomercial.  I'm also a little bit of a tightwad so the idea of dropping $300 on a Dyson just wasn't going to work for me.  Unless it was like Rosie the Robot and actually did the cleaning itself.The pros:- It works.  It actually picks up things off both my area rugs and hardwood floors.  I'm not stooping down to pick up pieces of sock lint or threads and feeding them into the vacuum.  And it doesn't shoot little pebbles or debris back at you or spread it in some other direction.  It just picks it up.- It easily transitions from low to high speed to go from hardwood/tile to carpet.  I can also use it on smaller area rugs without them getting sucked up into it (on both low and high speed).- It's easy to detach the hand held part from the bottom part.  There are three attachments that go directly on the handheld - a crevice tool, one with a brush on it, and one something like a lint brush on it (I think it's meant to pick up pet hair - we have a dog but he doesn't shed so I can't comment on how good it works).  There's also a hardwood floor cleaner with a washable pad that you can attach to the end of the wand.  You can also attach the other pieces to the end of the wand - I use the brush to clean baseboards and the crevice tool to get into corners, under the cabinets, etc.- It's easy to empty the dirt trap with minimal mess.- There's a washable filter that I would recommend washing frequently when you first start using this thing.  I noticed due to my long-term lack of vacuuming power that I was really sucking up a lot of extra dust the first few times I used it.- It's very lightweight (or as light as you can get and still have some power) and easy to maneuver.  I can get under couches, coffee tables, my bed and so on without stooping down too far or getting down on the floor.- The cord it nice and long. I can do each floor of my house (probably a 30'x30' space) without moving from outlet to outlet.- It comes with a car detailing kit that I frankly can't wait to use but we're still in the depths of winter so it will have to wait until the weather warms up.The cons:- It's top heavy so it doesn't stand up on it's own. You have to lean it against something or lay it down on the floor.  This is minor and not really an issue but you have to make sure you are careful so it doesn't fall over.- The attachments aren't ""on board"" and you can store them in the provided drawstring bag.  This means that you have to take them with you to have them handy when you want them.  This hasn't really been an issue but thought it was worth pointing out.- People have commented that the dirt receptacle is small and requires frequent emptying.  I'm happy to empty it since it seems to mean I'm actually cleaning something.  I usually empty it 2, maybe 3 times if I'm vacuuming the entire house.  It's easy to empty so this isn't a big deal in my book.In general, the pros far outweigh the cons and I would definitely recommend this vacuum if you're looking for what I was.  If you have all wall-to-wall, I'm not sure if you'll see the same results but for mixed floor types in an average sized house, I think this one can't be beat.
